libri-org_118-47824-0032 WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
libri-org_118-47824-0033 SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
libri-org_118-47824-0034 THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
libri-org_118-47824-0035 I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
libri-org_118-47824-0036 YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
libri-org_118-47824-0037 HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
libri-org_118-47824-0038 HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
libri-org_118-47824-0039 ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
libri-org_118-47824-0040 BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
libri-org_118-47824-0041 SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
libri-org_118-47824-0042 THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
libri-org_118-47824-0043 HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
libri-org_118-47824-0044 THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
libri-org_118-47824-0045 AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
libri-org_118-47824-0046 ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
libri-org_118-47824-0047 NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
libri-org_118-47824-0048 BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
libri-org_118-47824-0049 FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
libri-org_118-47824-0050 THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
libri-org_118-47824-0051 FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
libri-org_118-47824-0052 THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
libri-org_118-47824-0053 IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
libri-org_118-47824-0054 AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
libri-org_118-47824-0055 THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
libri-org_118-47824-0056 IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
libri-org_118-47824-0057 HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
libri-org_118-47824-0058 COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
libri-org_118-47824-0059 A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
libri-org_118-47824-0060 SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
libri-org_118-47824-0061 HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
libri-org_118-47824-0062 NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
libri-org_118-47824-0063 IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
libri-org_118-47824-0064 HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
libri-org_118-47824-0065 HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
libri-org_118-47824-0066 GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
libri-org_118-47824-0067 I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
libri-org_118-47824-0068 I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
libri-org_118-47824-0069 ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
libri-org_118-47824-0070 NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
libri-org_118-47824-0071 MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
libri-org_118-47824-0072 AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
libri-org_118-47824-0073 BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
libri-org_118-47824-0074 IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
libri-org_118-47824-0075 HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
libri-org_118-47824-0076 FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
libri-org_118-47824-0077 YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
libri-org_118-47824-0078 THE PANAMANIAN HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHING HE TOO WAS SOMBRELY DRESSED AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID NECKTIE HE HAD WORN FROM THE COURTHOUSE A JET BLACK SCARF WAS PERFECTLY ARRANGED BENEATH HIS COLLAR HE LOUNGED OPPOSITE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
libri-org_118-47824-0079 HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
libri-org_118-47824-0080 FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
libri-org_118-47824-0081 BOBBY FORCED HIMSELF TO WALK UP THE STAIRCASE FACING THE FIRST PHASE OF HIS ORDEAL HE SAW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REALIZED THAT TOO FOR HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND FOLLOWED BY RAWLINS STARTED UPWARD THE ENTIRE COMPANY CROWDED THE STAIRS

libri-org_1898-145715-0007 SEVERAL YEARS PASSED DURING WHICH TIME THE PRINCESS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO HER LONELY LIFE OBEYED THE FAIRY'S ORDERS AND BY DEGREES FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE COURT OF THE KING HER FATHER
libri-org_1898-145715-0008 SHE NOTICED THAT THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRODUCE A BRILLIANT RAINBOW SHE STOOD STILL TO ADMIRE IT WHEN TO HER GREAT SURPRISE SHE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESSING HER WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE CENTRE OF ITS RAYS
libri-org_1898-145715-0009 THE VOICE WAS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN AND ITS SWEETNESS OF TONE AND THE AGREEABLE THINGS IT UTTERED LED ONE TO INFER THAT ITS OWNER MUST BE EQUALLY CHARMING BUT THIS HAD TO BE A MERE MATTER OF FANCY FOR NO ONE WAS VISIBLE
libri-org_1898-145715-0010 THE BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW INFORMED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THAT HE WAS YOUNG THE SON OF A POWERFUL KING AND THAT THE FAIRY LAGREE WHO OWED HIS PARENTS A GRUDGE
libri-org_1898-145715-0011 HAD REVENGED HERSELF BY DEPRIVING HIM OF HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS THAT SHE HAD IMPRISONED HIM IN THE PALACE WHERE HE HAD FOUND HIS CONFINEMENT HARD TO BEAR FOR SOME TIME BUT NOW HE OWNED
libri-org_1898-145715-0012 HE NO LONGER SIGHED FOR FREEDOM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND LEARNED TO LOVE FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HE ADDED MANY OTHER TENDER SPEECHES TO THIS DECLARATION AND THE PRINCESS TO WHOM SUCH REMARKS WERE A NEW EXPERIENCE
libri-org_1898-145715-0013 COULD NOT HELP FEELING PLEASED AND TOUCHED BY HIS ATTENTIONS THE PRINCE COULD ONLY APPEAR OR SPEAK UNDER THE FORM OF A RAINBOW AND IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT THE SUN SHOULD SHINE ON WATER SO AS TO ENABLE THE RAYS TO FORM THEMSELVES
libri-org_1898-145715-0014 LAGREE ON HER RETURN SOON FOUND OUT THE NEGLECT AND SEEMED ONLY TOO PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HER SPITE TO HER LOVELY PRISONER
libri-org_1898-145715-0015 FOR FIRE WITH WHICH TO RELIGHT THE ONE SHE HAD ALLOWED TO GO OUT NOW THIS LOCRINOS WAS A CRUEL MONSTER WHO DEVOURED EVERYONE HE CAME ACROSS AND ESPECIALLY ENJOYED A CHANCE OF CATCHING
libri-org_1898-145715-0016 AND EATING ANY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HEROINE OBEYED WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER LOVER
libri-org_1898-145715-0017 AS TO CERTAIN DEATH AS SHE WAS CROSSING A WOOD A BIRD SANG TO HER TO PICK UP A SHINING PEBBLE WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IN A FOUNTAIN CLOSE BY AND TO USE IT WHEN NEEDED
libri-org_1898-145715-0018 SHE TOOK THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF LOCRINOS LUCKILY SHE ONLY FOUND HIS WIFE AT HOME WHO WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE PRINCESS'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND SWEET GENTLE MANNERS
libri-org_1898-145715-0019 SHE READILY LET FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAVE THE FIRE
libri-org_1898-145715-0020 CONVENIENT WAY OF MEETING THAN BY THE GARDEN FOUNTAIN AND FAIRER THAN A FAIRY CARRIED OUT HIS PLAN DAILY WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS EVERY MORNING SHE PLACED A LARGE BASIN FULL OF WATER ON HER WINDOW SILL AND AS SOON AS THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER
libri-org_1898-145715-0021 THE RAINBOW APPEARED AS CLEARLY AS IT HAD EVER DONE IN THE FOUNTAIN BY THIS MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO MEET WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FIRE OR OF THE TWO BOTTLES IN WHICH THE OLD FAIRY KEPT HER EYE AND HER TOOTH AT NIGHT
libri-org_1898-145715-0022 AND FOR SOME TIME THE LOVERS ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF SUNSHINE TOGETHER ONE DAY PRINCE RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF WOE HE HAD JUST HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BE BANISHED FROM THIS LOVELY SPOT BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS TO GO
libri-org_1898-145715-0023 THE POOR YOUNG COUPLE WERE IN DESPAIR AND ONLY PARTED WITH THE LAST RAY OF SUNSHINE AND IN HOPES OF MEETING NEXT MORNING ALAS NEXT DAY WAS DARK AND GLOOMY AND IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS FOR A FEW MINUTES
libri-org_1898-145715-0024 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY EAGERLY RAN TO THE WINDOW BUT IN HER HASTE SHE UPSET THE BASIN AND SPILT ALL THE WATER WITH WHICH SHE HAD CAREFULLY FILLED IT OVERNIGHT NO OTHER WATER WAS AT HAND EXCEPT THAT IN THE TWO BOTTLES
libri-org_1898-145715-0025 IT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING HER LOVER BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED AND SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE BOTTLE AND POUR THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARED AT ONCE THEIR FAREWELLS WERE FULL OF TENDERNESS
libri-org_1898-145715-0026 THE PRINCE MADE THE MOST ARDENT AND SINCERE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISED TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHICH MIGHT HELP TO DELIVER HIS DEAR FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND IMPLORED HER TO CONSENT TO THEIR MARRIAGE AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD BOTH BE FREE
libri-org_1898-145715-0027 THE PRINCESS ON HER SIDE VOWED TO HAVE NO OTHER HUSBAND AND DECLARED HERSELF WILLING TO BRAVE DEATH ITSELF IN ORDER TO REJOIN HIM THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED MUCH TIME FOR THEIR ADIEUS THE RAINBOW VANISHED AND THE PRINCESS RESOLVED TO RUN ALL RISKS
libri-org_1898-145715-0028 STARTED OFF AT ONCE TAKING NOTHING WITH HER BUT HER DOG HER CAT A SPRIG OF MYRTLE AND THE STONE WHICH THE WIFE OF LOCRINOS GAVE HER WHEN LAGREE BECAME AWARE OF HER PRISONER'S FLIGHT
libri-org_1898-145715-0029 AS SHE DID SO THE SPRIG OF MYRTLE SHE CARRIED TOUCHED THE GROUND AND IMMEDIATELY A GREEN AND SHADY BOWER SPRANG UP ROUND HER IN WHICH SHE HOPED TO SLEEP IN PEACE BUT LAGREE HAD NOT GIVEN UP HER PURSUIT
libri-org_1898-145715-0030 AND ARRIVED JUST AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAD FALLEN FAST ASLEEP THIS TIME SHE MADE SURE OF CATCHING HER VICTIM BUT THE CAT SPIED HER OUT
libri-org_1898-145715-0031 SHE FLEW AT LAGREE'S FACE AND TORE OUT HER ONLY EYE THUS DELIVERING THE PRINCESS FOR EVER FROM HER PERSECUTOR
libri-org_1898-145715-0032 BUT NO SOONER HAD LAGREE BEEN PUT TO FIGHT THAN OUR HEROINE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HUNGER AND THIRST SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPIRE AND IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT SHE DRAGGED HERSELF AS FAR
libri-org_1898-145715-0033 WHICH STOOD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE HERE SHE WAS RECEIVED BY A BEAUTIFUL LADY DRESSED IN GREEN AND WHITE TO MATCH THE HOUSE WHICH APPARENTLY BELONGED TO HER AND OF WHICH SHE SEEMED THE ONLY INHABITANT
libri-org_1898-145715-0034 SHE GAVE HER A NUT DESIRING HER ONLY TO OPEN IT IN THE MOST URGENT NEED AFTER A LONG AND TIRING JOURNEY FAIRER THAN A FAIRY WAS ONCE MORE RECEIVED IN A HOUSE AND BY A LADY EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE SHE

libri-org_1898-145715-0038 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THANKED HER WARMLY AND RESUMED HER WAY CHEERED BY PLEASANT THOUGHTS AFTER A TIME HER ROAD LED THROUGH A WOOD FULL OF SOFT AIRS AND SWEET ODOURS AND BEFORE SHE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS SHE SAW A WONDERFUL SILVER CASTLE
libri-org_1898-145715-0039 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO ENTER THIS CASTLE BUT BESIDES BEING HUNG A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE NEITHER DOORS NOR WINDOWS SHE HAD NO DOUBT THOUGH REALLY I CANNOT THINK WHY
libri-org_1898-145715-0040 THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME IN WHICH TO USE THE NUT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER SHE OPENED IT AND OUT CAME A DIMINUTIVE HALL PORTER
libri-org_1898-145715-0041 YOU EVER SAW THE PRINCESS CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE SILVER CHAINS HOLDING IN HER HAND THE LITTLE PORTER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS MINUTE SIZE OPENED A SECRET DOOR WITH HIS GOLDEN KEY AND LET HER IN
libri-org_1898-145715-0042 SHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED STARS IN THE CEILING
libri-org_1898-145715-0043 WHO NOW SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS REAL SHAPE
libri-org_1898-145715-0044 ON OPENING IT FOUND THAT ALL THE SEEDS WERE AS MANY LITTLE VIOLINS WHICH FLEW UP IN THE VAULTED ROOF AND AT ONCE BEGAN PLAYING MELODIOUSLY
libri-org_1898-145715-0045 THE PRINCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY ROUSED BUT HE OPENED HIS EYES A LITTLE AND LOOKED ALL THE HANDSOMER IMPATIENT AT NOT BEING RECOGNISED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY NOW DREW OUT HER THIRD PRESENT AND ON OPENING THE CRYSTAL SCENT BOTTLE A LITTLE SYREN FLEW OUT
libri-org_1898-145715-0046 AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WALLS OF THE ROOM EXPANDED AND OPENED OUT REVEALING A GOLDEN THRONE COVERED WITH JEWELS

libri-org_19-198-0001 THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
libri-org_19-198-0002 NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
libri-org_19-198-0003 THE PUBLIC ARE ENTREATED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE IT WAS FINISHED MANY MORE SINCE IT WAS BEGUN AND THAT DURING THAT PERIOD PLACES MANNERS BOOKS AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGES
libri-org_19-198-0004 CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
libri-org_19-198-0005 THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN
libri-org_19-198-0006 HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN
libri-org_19-198-0007 WHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANY
libri-org_19-198-0008 SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
libri-org_19-198-0009 DARK LANK HAIR AND STRONG FEATURES SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM SEEMED HER MIND SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS AND GREATLY PREFERRED CRICKET
libri-org_19-198-0010 NOT MERELY TO DOLLS BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF INFANCY NURSING A DORMOUSE FEEDING A CANARY BIRD OR WATERING A ROSE BUSH INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDEN
libri-org_19-198-0011 AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
libri-org_19-198-0012 HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
libri-org_19-198-0013 HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANS
libri-org_19-198-0014 SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
libri-org_19-198-0015 SO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN SHE LEARNT A YEAR AND COULD NOT BEAR IT AND MISSUS MORLAND WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFF
libri-org_19-198-0016 FRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD
libri-org_19-198-0017 HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
libri-org_19-198-0018 SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE
libri-org_19-198-0019 HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
libri-org_19-198-0020 CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
libri-org_19-198-0021 THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
libri-org_19-198-0022 THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
libri-org_19-198-0023 AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
libri-org_19-198-0024 SHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLE
libri-org_19-198-0025 MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
libri-org_19-198-0026 AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
libri-org_19-198-0027 THAT THE POOR BEETLE WHICH WE TREAD UPON IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT AS WHEN A GIANT DIES AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKS
libri-org_19-198-0028 LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
libri-org_19-198-0029 SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
libri-org_19-198-0030 HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN
libri-org_19-198-0031 THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
libri-org_19-198-0032 WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
libri-org_19-198-0033 THIS WAS STRANGE INDEED BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT THERE WAS NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO NOT EVEN A BARONET
libri-org_19-198-0034 THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
libri-org_19-198-0035 BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
libri-org_19-198-0036 WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF

libri-org_1970-28415-0000 THEY UNTIED IT AND LED IT AWAY SOME OF THEM PUT THEIR CLOTHES ON THE DONKEY'S BACK FOR A KING MUST RIDE IN COMFORT OTHERS SPREAD THEIR CLOTHES OUT ON THE STREET FOR A KING SHOULD RIDE IN STATE
libri-org_1970-28415-0001 JESUS GOT ON THE DONKEY AND STARTED FOR JERUSALEM THE DISCIPLES WALKED AHEAD WHEN THEY HAD ALMOST REACHED THE CITY THE DISCIPLES BEGAN TO SHOUT JESUS USED TO SAY THAT THEY MUST NOT TELL ANYONE THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH
libri-org_1970-28415-0002 BUT NOW THEY COULD TELL THE WHOLE WORLD FOR JESUS WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THEY WERE GLAD THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE QUIET ANY LONGER
libri-org_1970-28415-0003 AND WAS A CRY OF WELCOME THEY SHOUTED THE WORDS OF A PSALM HOSANNA TO THE SON OF DAVID
libri-org_1970-28415-0004 HOSANNA IN THE HIGHEST THE CITY WAS CROWDED WITH TRAVELERS FROM ALL OVER PALESTINE AND FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TOO THEY WERE THE PILGRIMS WHO HAD COME FOR THE PASSOVER FEAST THE CROWDS SAW THE PROCESSION COMING THEY SAW THE DONKEY
libri-org_1970-28415-0005 SOME OF THE CROWDS BEGAN TO SHOUT WITH THE DISCIPLES A GREAT CRY OF HOSANNA WENT RINGING DOWN THE STREET EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING IT

libri-org_1970-28415-0009 THIS TIME HE CARRIED A WHIP IN THE COURT OF THE GENTILES THE MONEY WAS CLINKING AS IT HAD DONE WHEN JESUS WAS A BOY AT TABLES SAT THE MEN WHO GREW RICH BY EXCHANGING THE MONEY OF VISITORS FOR COINS USED IN JERUSALEM
libri-org_1970-28415-0010 OTHERS WERE SELLING DOVES FOR SACRIFICE THE POOR HAD TO PAY HEAVILY TO WORSHIP GOD IN HIS OWN HOUSE JESUS STRODE DOWN THE ROOM WITH THE WHIP IN HIS HAND AND UPSET THE TABLES WHERE THE MONEY WAS
libri-org_1970-28415-0011 WHEN THE MEN JUMPED UP FROM THEIR CHAIRS HE DROVE THEM OUT OF THE TEMPLE THEN HE DROVE THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE OUT AFTER THE MEN IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPTURES GOD'S HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER
libri-org_1970-28415-0012 BUT YOU HAVE MADE IT INTO A DEN OF THIEVES AND ROBBERS HE CRIED THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLE AND ALL THE IMPORTANT MEN WHO RULED JERUSALEM THE NEXT DAY SOME OF THE RULERS CAME TO JESUS AND SAID

libri-org_1970-28415-0014 BUT JESUS WAS TOO QUICK FOR THEM HE SAID I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IF YOU ANSWER A QUESTION OF MINE WHEN JOHN THE BAPTIST USED TO PREACH TO YOU AND BAPTIZE PEOPLE WHO GAVE HIM THE RIGHT TO DO THAT
libri-org_1970-28415-0015 THEN THE RULERS DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY THEY THOUGHT TO THEMSELVES NOW IF WE SAY THAT JOHN WAS SENT BY GOD TO PREACH HE WILL SAY WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO HIM THEN IF WE SAY THAT JOHN DIDN'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO PREACH
libri-org_1970-28415-0016 NEITHER AM I GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT I HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS EVERY DAY THAT WEEK JESUS CAME AND TAUGHT IN THE TEMPLE SEVERAL TIMES HIS ENEMIES TRIED TO TRICK HIM INTO SAYING SOMETHING THAT WOULD TURN THE PEOPLE AGAINST HIM
libri-org_1970-28415-0017 BUT JESUS ALWAYS HAD AN ANSWER WHICH SILENCED THEM ONCE THEY CAME AND ASKED SHOULD WE PAY TAXES TO THE ROMANS THAT WAS A HARD QUESTION
libri-org_1970-28415-0018 EVERYBODY WOULD HATE HIM TOO BUT IF HE SAID THEY SHOULD NOT PAY THE TAXES WELL THEY COULD COUNT ON THE ROMAN GOVERNOR TO SETTLE WITH JESUS THEN
libri-org_1970-28415-0019 THERE WAS A MAN'S PICTURE STAMPED ON ONE SIDE OF IT JESUS SAID WHOSE PICTURE IS THAT WHY THEY ANSWERED THAT IS A PICTURE OF CAESAR THE EMPEROR OF ROME ALL RIGHT SAID JESUS

libri-org_2416-152139-0048 YOU JIMMIE DALE'S VOICE CHOKED AGAIN YOU BLOT ON GOD'S EARTH YOU SLIPPED THE MONEY AND TICKET UNDER THE CHILD'S MATTRESS CARLING CAME FORWARD WITH A LURCH IN HIS CHAIR AND HIS HANDS WENT OUT
libri-org_2416-152139-0049 AND IT WAS SAFER MUCH MORE CIRCUMSPECT ON YOUR PART NOT TO ORDER THE FLAT SEARCHED AT ONCE BUT ONLY AS A LAST RESORT AS IT WERE AFTER YOU HAD LED THE POLICE TO TRAIL HIM ALL EVENING AND STILL REMAIN WITHOUT A CLEW
libri-org_2416-152139-0050 AND BESIDES OF COURSE NOT UNTIL YOU HAD PLANTED THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS TO DAMN HIM AND WRECK HIS LIFE AND HOME YOU WERE EVEN GENEROUS IN THE AMOUNT YOU DEPRIVED YOURSELF OF OUT OF THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
libri-org_2416-152139-0051 EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD DONE THE JOB AND HAD THE BALANCE SOMEWHERE WHAT WOULD HIS DENIALS HIS PROTESTATIONS OF INNOCENCE COUNT FOR HE WAS AN EX CONVICT A HARDENED CRIMINAL CAUGHT RED HANDED WITH A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS OF ROBBERY
libri-org_2416-152139-0052 AND THEN JIMMIE DALE LAUGHED NOT PLEASANTLY YES THERE'S A WAY CARLING HE SAID GRIMLY THAT'S WHY I'M HERE HE PICKED UP A SHEET OF WRITING PAPER AND PUSHED IT ACROSS THE DESK THEN A PEN
libri-org_2416-152139-0053 NO HE CRIED I WON'T I CAN'T MY GOD I I WON'T THE AUTOMATIC IN JIMMIE DALE'S HAND EDGED FORWARD THE FRACTION OF AN INCH I HAVE NOT USED THIS YET YOU UNDERSTAND NOW WHY DON'T YOU HE SAID UNDER HIS BREATH
libri-org_2416-152139-0054 NO NO CARLING PUSHED AWAY THE PEN I'M RUINED RUINED AS IT IS BUT THIS WOULD MEAN THE PENITENTIARY TOO WHERE YOU TRIED TO SEND AN INNOCENT MAN IN YOUR PLACE YOU HOUND WHERE YOU SOME OTHER WAY
libri-org_2416-152139-0055 CARLING WAS BABBLING LET ME OUT OF THIS FOR GOD'S SAKE LET ME OUT OF THIS CARLING SAID JIMMIE DALE HOARSELY I STOOD BESIDE A LITTLE BED TO NIGHT AND LOOKED AT A BABY GIRL A LITTLE BABY GIRL WITH GOLDEN HAIR
libri-org_2416-152139-0056 WHO SMILED AS SHE SLEPT CARLING SHIVERED AND PASSED A SHAKING HAND ACROSS HIS FACE TAKE THIS PEN SAID JIMMIE DALE MONOTONOUSLY OR THIS THE AUTOMATIC
libri-org_2416-152139-0057 LIFTED UNTIL THE MUZZLE WAS ON A LINE WITH CARLING'S EYES CARLING'S HAND REACHED OUT STILL SHAKING AND TOOK THE PEN AND HIS BODY DRAGGED LIMPLY FORWARD HUNG OVER THE DESK
libri-org_2416-152139-0058 THE PEN SPLUTTERED ON THE PAPER A BEAD OF SWEAT SPURTING FROM THE MAN'S FOREHEAD DROPPED TO THE SHEET THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE ROOM A MINUTE PASSED ANOTHER
libri-org_2416-152139-0059 CARLING'S PEN TRAVELLED HALTINGLY ACROSS THE PAPER THEN WITH A QUEER LOW CRY AS HE SIGNED HIS NAME HE DROPPED THE PEN FROM HIS FINGERS AND RISING UNSTEADILY FROM HIS CHAIR
libri-org_2416-152139-0060 I GUESS IT'S ALL UP I GUESS I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOME DAY MOYNE HADN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT I STOLE THE MONEY MYSELF FROM THE BANK TO NIGHT I GUESS IT'S ALL UP
libri-org_2416-152139-0061 THOMAS H CARLING FROM THE PAPER JIMMIE DALE'S EYES SHIFTED TO THE FIGURE BY THE COUCH AND THE PAPER FLUTTERED SUDDENLY FROM HIS FINGERS TO THE DESK CARLING WAS REELING CLUTCHING AT HIS THROAT
libri-org_2416-152139-0062 A SMALL GLASS VIAL ROLLED UPON THE CARPET AND THEN EVEN AS JIMMIE DALE SPRANG FORWARD THE OTHER PITCHED HEAD LONG OVER THE COUCH AND IN A MOMENT IT WAS OVER PRESENTLY JIMMIE DALE PICKED UP THE VIAL
libri-org_2416-152139-0063 AND DROPPED IT BACK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN THERE WAS NO LABEL ON IT BUT IT NEEDED NONE THE STRONG PENETRATING ODOR OF BITTER ALMONDS WAS TELLTALE EVIDENCE ENOUGH IT WAS PRUSSIC
libri-org_2416-152139-0064 OR HYDROCYANIC ACID PROBABLY THE MOST DEADLY POISON AND THE SWIFTEST IN ITS ACTION THAT WAS KNOWN TO SCIENCE CARLING HAD PROVIDED AGAINST THAT SOME DAY IN HIS CONFESSION FOR A LITTLE SPACE
libri-org_2416-152139-0065 MOTIONLESS JIMMIE DALE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE SILENT OUTSTRETCHED FORM THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE DESK AND SLOWLY DELIBERATELY PICKED UP THE SIGNED CONFESSION AND THE STEAMSHIP TICKET HE HELD THEM AN INSTANT
libri-org_2416-152139-0066 STARING AT THEM THEN METHODICALLY BEGAN TO TEAR THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES A STRANGE TIRED SMILE HOVERING ON HIS LIPS THE MAN WAS DEAD NOW THERE WOULD BE DISGRACE ENOUGH FOR SOME ONE TO BEAR A MOTHER PERHAPS
libri-org_2416-152139-0067 WHO KNEW AND THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY NOW SINCE THE MAN WAS DEAD JIMMIE DALE PUT THE PIECES IN HIS POCKET WENT TO THE SAFE OPENED IT AND TOOK OUT A PARCEL LOCKED THE SAFE CAREFULLY
libri-org_2416-152139-0068 AND CARRIED THE PARCEL TO THE DESK HE OPENED IT THERE INSIDE WERE NEARLY TWO DOZEN LITTLE PACKAGES OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS THE OTHER TWO PACKAGES THAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM HE ADDED TO THE REST
libri-org_2416-152139-0069 FROM HIS POCKET HE TOOK OUT THE THIN METAL INSIGNIA CASE AND WITH THE TINY TWEEZERS LIFTED UP ONE OF THE GRAY COLOURED DIAMOND SHAPED PAPER SEALS HE MOISTENED THE ADHESIVE SIDE AND
libri-org_2416-152139-0070 STILL HOLDING IT BY THE TWEEZERS DROPPED IT ON HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND PRESSED THE SEAL DOWN ON THE FACE OF THE TOPMOST PACKAGE OF BANKNOTES HE TIED THE PARCEL UP THEN AND PICKING UP THE PEN ADDRESSED IT IN PRINTED CHARACTERS
libri-org_2416-152139-0071 WITH THE PARCEL UNDER HIS ARM STEPPED TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCKED IT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT ON THE THRESHOLD FOR A SINGLE QUICK COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM THEN PASSED ON OUT INTO THE STREET
libri-org_2416-152139-0072 AT THE CORNER HE STOPPED TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE AND THE FLAME OF THE MATCH SPURTING UP DISCLOSED A FACE THAT WAS WORN AND HAGGARD HE THREW THE MATCH AWAY SMILED A LITTLE WEARILY AND WENT ON
libri-org_3242-8112-0000 MANTELISH EXCUSED HIMSELF AND WENT OFF WITH THE MESSENGER THE DOOR CLOSED QUILLAN CAME BACK TO HIS CHAIR WE'RE MOVING THE OUTFIT LATER TONIGHT THE COMMISSIONER EXPLAINED
libri-org_3242-8112-0001 EIGHT TONS OF HIS LAB EQUIPMENT PLUS HIS SPECIAL U LEAGUE GUARDS OH TRIGGER PICKED UP THE PUYA GLASS SHE LOOKED INTO IT IT WAS EMPTY MOVING WHERE SHE ASKED MANON SAID THE COMMISSIONER TELL YOU ABOUT THAT LATER
libri-org_3242-8112-0002 EVERY LAST MUSCLE IN TRIGGER'S BODY SEEMED TO GO LIMP SIMULTANEOUSLY SHE SETTLED BACK SLIGHTLY IN THE CHAIR SURPRISED BY THE FORCE OF THE REACTION SHE HADN'T REALIZED BY NOW HOW KEYED UP SHE WAS SHE SIGHED A SMALL SIGH
libri-org_3242-8112-0003 THEN SHE SMILED AT QUILLAN MAJOR SHE SAID HOW ABOUT A TINY LITTLE REFILL ON THAT PUYA ABOUT HALF QUILLAN TOOK CARE OF THE TINY LITTLE REFILL COMMISSIONER TATE SAID BY THE WAY
libri-org_3242-8112-0004 QUILLAN DOES HAVE A DEGREE IN SUBSPACE ENGINEERING AND GETS ASSIGNED TO THE ENGINEERS NOW AND THEN BUT HIS REAL JOB'S SPACE SCOUT INTELLIGENCE TRIGGER NODDED I'D ALMOST GUESSED IT SHE GAVE QUILLAN ANOTHER SMILE
libri-org_3242-8112-0005 AND NOW SAID THE COMMISSIONER WE'LL TALK MORE FREELY WE TELL MANTELISH JUST AS LITTLE AS WE CAN TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH TRIGGER THE PROFESSOR IS A TERRIBLE HANDICAP ON AN OPERATION LIKE THIS I UNDERSTAND HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S YES SHE SAID
libri-org_3242-8112-0006 GOING OVER FOR VISITS TO MANTELISH'S GARDEN WITH MY FATHER IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST THINGS I REMEMBER I CAN IMAGINE HE'S A PROBLEM SHE SHIFTED HER GAZE CURIOUSLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE TWO MEN WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING
libri-org_3242-8112-0007 LOOKING FOR GESS FAYLE AND THE KEY UNIT HOLATI TATE SAID THAT'S ABOUT IT WE'RE ONE OF A FEW THOUSAND FEDERATION GROUPS ASSIGNED TO THE SAME GENERAL JOB EACH GROUP WORKS AT ITS SPECIALTIES AND THE INFORMATION GETS CORRELATED
libri-org_3242-8112-0008 IN WHAT WAY TRIGGER ASKED WELL SUPPOSE THAT KEY UNIT IS LOST AND STAYS LOST SUPPOSE ALL THE OTHER PLASMOIDS PUT TOGETHER DON'T CONTAIN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO SHOW HOW THE OLD GALACTICS PRODUCED THE THINGS AND GOT THEM TO OPERATE
libri-org_3242-8112-0009 SOMEBODY WOULD GET THAT WORKED OUT PRETTY SOON WOULDN'T THEY
libri-org_3242-8112-0010 THERE SEEM TO BE TOO MANY BASIC FACTORS MISSING IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF SCIENCES FIRST AND THAT COULD TAKE A FEW CENTURIES WELL TRIGGER ADMITTED I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT THE THINGS INDEFINITELY
libri-org_3242-8112-0011 SAME HERE THE PLASMOID NABOB AGREED UNGRATEFULLY WEIRD BEASTIES BUT LET'S SEE AT PRESENT THERE ARE TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER WORLDS TO THE FEDERATION AREN'T THERE MORE OR LESS
libri-org_3242-8112-0012 AND THE NUMBER OF PLANETARY CONFEDERACIES SUBPLANETARY GOVERNMENTS INDUSTRIAL FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL COMBINES ASSORTED POWER GROUPS ET CETERA AND SO ON IS SOMETHING I'D HATE TO HAVE TO CALCULATE WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT SHE ASKED
libri-org_3242-8112-0013 THEY'VE ALL BEEN TOLD WE'RE HEADING FOR A NEW GOLDEN AGE COURTESY OF THE PLASMOID SCIENCE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY HAS BELIEVED IT NOW THERE'S CONSIDERABLE DOUBT
libri-org_3242-8112-0014 OF COURSE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GET VERY UNHAPPY EH THAT SAID COMMISSIONER TATE IS ONLY A LITTLE OF IT YES THE THING ISN'T JUST LOST SOMEBODY'S GOT IT VERY LIKELY TRIGGER NODDED
libri-org_3242-8112-0015 SO ANY ONE OF UMPTEEN THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE HUB MIGHT BE THE ONE THAT HAS THAT PLASMOID NOW INCLUDING SAID HOLATI ANY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN RESTRICTED WORLDS
libri-org_3242-8112-0016 THEIR TREATIES OF LIMITATION WOULDN'T HAVE LET THEM GET INTO THE PLASMOID PIE UNTIL THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AT IT A DECADE OR SO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EAGER THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE THEN TRIGGER SAID LORDY
libri-org_3242-8112-0017 THE THING COULD EVEN SET OFF ANOTHER STRING OF WARS THAT'S A POINT THE COUNCIL IS NERVOUS ABOUT HE SAID WELL IT CERTAINLY IS A MESS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE FEDERATION MIGHT HAVE HAD A SECURITY CHIEF IN ON THAT FIRST OPERATION
libri-org_3242-8112-0018 RIGHT THERE ON HARVEST MOON THEY DID HE SAID IT WAS FAYLE
libri-org_3242-8112-0019 HOLATI COULD THOSE THINGS EVER BECOME AS VALUABLE AS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING IT'S ALL SOUNDED A LITTLE EXAGGERATED TO ME THE COMMISSIONER SAID HE'D WONDERED ABOUT IT TOO
libri-org_3242-8112-0020 I'M NOT ENOUGH OF A BIOLOGIST TO MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS WHAT IT SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO IS THAT THEY MIGHT WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TEMPT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GAMBLE VERY HIGH FOR A CHANCE TO GET CONTROL OF THE PLASMOID PROCESS
libri-org_3242-8112-0021 AND WE KNOW DEFINITELY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GAMBLING FOR IT HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING A COUPLE OF LEADS HERE PRETTY SHORT LEADS SO FAR BUT YOU WORK WITH WHAT YOU CAN GET HE NODDED AT THE TABLE
libri-org_3242-8112-0022 TRIGGER GLANCED DOWN THE PLASMOID LAY THERE SOME INCHES FROM THE SIDE OF HER HAND YOU KNOW SHE SAID UNCOMFORTABLY OLD REPULSIVE MOVED AGAIN WHILE WE WERE TALKING TOWARDS MY HAND SHE DREW THE HAND AWAY
libri-org_3242-8112-0023 I WAS WATCHING IT MAJOR QUILLAN SAID REASSURINGLY FROM THE END OF THE TABLE
libri-org_3242-8112-0024 MANTELISH BROUGHT IT BACK TO MACCADON WITH HIM
libri-org_3242-8112-0025 HE WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T EVEN GUESS AT WHAT ITS FUNCTION WAS IT WAS JUST LYING THERE IN A CUBICLE SO HE DID CONSIDERABLE EXPERIMENTING WITH IT WHILE HE WAITED FOR GESS FAYLE TO SHOW UP
libri-org_3242-8112-0026 AND LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS FIDGETED AROUND HOPING TO GET THE KIND OF REPORT FROM MANTELISH AND FAYLE THAT MANTELISH THOUGHT THEY'D ALREADY RECEIVED THEY WERE WONDERING WHERE FAYLE WAS TOO BUT THEY KNEW FAYLE WAS SECURITY SO THEY DIDN'T LIKE TO GET TOO NOSY
libri-org_3242-8112-0027 TRIGGER SHOOK HER HEAD WONDERFUL SO
libri-org_3242-8112-0028 MANTELISH BEGAN TO GET RESULTS WITH IT THE COMMISSIONER SAID ONE EXPERIMENT WAS RATHER STARTLING HE'D BEEN TRYING THAT ELECTRICAL STIMULATION BUSINESS NOTHING HAPPENED UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED THEN HE TOUCHED THE PLASMOID AND IT FED THE WHOLE CHARGE BACK TO HIM
libri-org_3242-8112-0029 SHE LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY GOOD FOR REPULSIVE STOOD UP FOR HIS RIGHTS EH MANTELISH GAINED SOME SUCH IMPRESSION ANYWAY HE BECAME MORE CAUTIOUS WITH IT AFTER THAT AND THEN HE LEARNED SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT
libri-org_3242-8112-0030 HE WAS VISITING ANOTHER LAB WHERE THEY HAD A COUPLE OF PLASMOIDS WHICH ACTUALLY MOVED NOW AND THEN
libri-org_3242-8112-0031 THE TWO LAB PLASMOIDS STOPPED MOVING WHILE HE WAS THERE THEY HAVEN'T MOVED SINCE
libri-org_3242-8112-0032 RIGHT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THEN LOCATED ANOTHER MOVING PLASMOID
libri-org_3242-8112-0033 THE BIG ONE INDUCES PLASMOID ACTIVITY THE LITTLE ONE MODIFIES IT
libri-org_3242-8112-0034 BUT HIS TWO LAB GUARDS AND ONE OF THE RAIDERS WERE KILLED THE OTHERS GOT AWAY GESS FAYLE'S DEFECTION WAS A CERTAINTY BY THEN AND EVERYBODY WAS VERY NERVOUS THE FEDS GOT THERE FAST AND DEAD BRAINED THE RAIDER THEY LEARNED JUST TWO THINGS
libri-org_3242-8112-0035 ONE HE'D BEEN MIND BLOCKED AND COULDN'T HAVE SPILLED ANY SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION EVEN IF THEY HAD GOT HIM ALIVE THE OTHER ITEM THEY DREW FROM HIS BRAIN WAS A CLEAR IMPRESSION OF THE TARGET OF THE RAID THE PROFESSOR'S PAL HERE UH HUH TRIGGER SAID LOST IN THOUGHT
libri-org_3242-8112-0036 SHE POKED REPULSIVE LIGHTLY THAT WOULD BE FAYLE AND HIS ASSOCIATES THEN OR SOMEBODY WHO KNEW ABOUT THEM DID THEY WANT TO KILL IT OR GRAB IT THE COMMISSIONER LOOKED AT HER GRAB IT WAS THE DEAD BRAIN REPORT WHY
libri-org_3242-8112-0037 SO THEY NEED IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE KEY UNIT TRIGGER ASKED PROBABLY THAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK VERY MUCH BETTER DOESN'T IT QUITE A LITTLE HE SAID THE UNIT MAY NOT WORK
libri-org_3242-8112-0038 MANTELISH TALKS OF SOMETHING HE CALLS PROXIMITY INFLUENCE
libri-org_3242-8112-0039 SO TRIGGER SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE TWO THIRDS OF WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE THIRD RIGHT HERE ON THE TABLE HOW MANY OF THE LATER RAIDERS DID YOU CATCH ALL OF THEM SAID THE COMMISSIONER AROUND FORTY
libri-org_3242-8112-0040 WE GOT THEM DEAD WE GOT THEM ALIVE IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE THEY WERE HIRED HANDS VERY EXPENSIVE HIRED HANDS BUT STILL JUST THAT MOST OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW A THING WE COULD USE THE ONES THAT DID KNOW SOMETHING WERE MIND BLOCKED AGAIN
libri-org_3242-8112-0041 I THOUGHT TRIGGER SAID REFLECTIVELY YOU COULD UN BLOCK SOMEONE LIKE THAT YOU CAN SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT AND IF YOU HAVE TIME ENOUGH WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO WAIT A YEAR THEY DIED BEFORE THEY COULD TELL US ANYTHING
libri-org_3242-8112-0042 THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN TRIGGER ASKED HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS PERSONALLY MORE OR LESS BY ACCIDENT THE COMMISSIONER SAID IT WAS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECOND LEAD THAT'S ME HUH SHE SAID UNHAPPILY YES
libri-org_3242-8112-0043 WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GRAB ME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET WE'RE HOPING WE WILL IN A VERY FEW DAYS IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN'T TELL ME ABOUT
libri-org_3242-8112-0044 I CAN TELL YOU MOST OF WHAT I KNOW AT THE MOMENT SAID THE COMMISSIONER
libri-org_332-128985-0000 WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
libri-org_332-128985-0001 AND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH
libri-org_332-128985-0002 HE NEVER HAD AN INTENTION OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE AS SOON AS HE GREW TO BE A MAN HE BECAME A BLOODY BUCCANEER AND AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE JOINED A PIRATE CREW AND HAD MADE BUT A FEW VOYAGES WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED BY HIS COMPANIONS
libri-org_332-128985-0003 THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
libri-org_332-128985-0004 HE FELL IN WITH A SPANISH SHIP LOADED WITH SILVER BULLION HAVING CAPTURED THIS HE SAILED WITH HIS PRIZE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE ENGLISH BUCCANEERS THERE HIS SUCCESS DELIGHTED THE COMMUNITY
libri-org_332-128985-0005 HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
libri-org_332-128985-0006 WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONE
libri-org_332-128985-0007 HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS PRAISES AND AS IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ROC IS DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST OF BIRDS SO IN THE EYES OF THE BUCCANEER BIOGRAPHER THIS ROC WAS THE GREATEST OF PIRATES
libri-org_332-128985-0008 THAT ROC NOW BECAME FAMOUS THE BETTER HE BECAME KNOWN THE MORE GENERAL WAS THE FEAR AND RESPECT FELT FOR HIM AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE MOTHERS OF THE ISLANDS USED TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP BY THREATENING THEM WITH THE TERRIBLE ROC IF THEY DID NOT CLOSE THEIR EYES
libri-org_332-128985-0009 THIS STORY HOWEVER I REGARD WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT
libri-org_332-128985-0010 BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANS
libri-org_332-128985-0011 THIS RENOWNED PIRATE FROM BRAZIL MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO LOOK AT HE WAS STRONG AND BRAWNY HIS FACE WAS SHORT AND VERY WIDE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES AND HIS EXPRESSION PROBABLY RESEMBLED THAT OF A PUG DOG
libri-org_332-128985-0012 HIS EYEBROWS WERE ENORMOUSLY LARGE AND BUSHY AND FROM UNDER THEM HE GLARED AT HIS MUNDANE SURROUNDINGS HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOSE SPIRIT COULD BE QUELLED BY LOOKING HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE EYE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM IN THE DAYTIME TO WALK ABOUT
libri-org_332-128985-0013 CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
libri-org_332-128985-0014 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
libri-org_332-128985-0015 BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
libri-org_332-128985-0016 ON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNK
libri-org_332-128985-0017 WITH HIS CUTLASS WAVING HIGH IN THE AIR HE WOULD RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET AND TAKE A WHACK AT EVERY ONE WHOM HE MET AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE THE CITIZENS ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE THE STREET TO HIMSELF AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIKELY
libri-org_332-128985-0018 THAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBRED
libri-org_332-128985-0019 FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
libri-org_332-128985-0020 IN HIS NATURE THERE WAS NO ALLOY NOR MODERATION NOR FORBEARANCE THE APPRECIATIVE ESQUEMELING WHO MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOSWELL OF THE BUCCANEERS COULD NEVER HAVE MET HIS HERO ROC
libri-org_332-128985-0021 WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
libri-org_332-128985-0022 BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIES
libri-org_332-128985-0023 BUT IN ALL THE INSTANCES OF FEROCIOUS ENMITY TOWARD THE SPANIARDS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE FEELINGS OF ROC THE BRAZILIAN UPON THAT SUBJECT HIS DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING SPANISH AROSE HE DECLARED
libri-org_332-128985-0024 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERS
libri-org_332-128985-0025 THEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COAST
libri-org_332-128985-0026 DIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEAS
libri-org_332-128985-0027 HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
libri-org_332-128985-0028 AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVER
libri-org_332-128985-0029 AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
libri-org_332-128985-0030 BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
libri-org_332-128985-0031 AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
libri-org_332-128985-0032 ROC MUST HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN POWERS OR PERHAPS HE RELIED SOMEWHAT UPON THE FEAR WHICH HIS VERY PRESENCE EVOKED BUT HE MADE A MISTAKE THIS TIME HE HAD RUN INTO THE LION'S JAW AND THE LION HAD CLOSED HIS TEETH UPON HIM
libri-org_332-128985-0033 WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
libri-org_332-128985-0034 AND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELF
libri-org_332-128985-0035 DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
libri-org_332-128985-0036 THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
libri-org_332-128985-0037 OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
libri-org_332-128985-0038 INSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOW
libri-org_332-128985-0039 AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
libri-org_332-128985-0040 WHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SO
libri-org_332-128985-0041 HE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALS
libri-org_332-128985-0042 AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
libri-org_332-128985-0043 WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
libri-org_332-128985-0044 BY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVER
libri-org_332-128985-0045 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WOULD HE GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD WHO MIGHT FALL INTO HIS HANDS AND HE MOREOVER THREATENED THAT ANY KIND OF VENGEANCE WHICH SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THE BUCCANEERS AND FRENCH UNITED TO INFLICT UPON THE SPANISH SHIPS
libri-org_332-128985-0046 OR UPON THE TOWN OF CAMPEACHY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY INJURY THAT MIGHT BE INFLICTED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO WERE THEN LYING IMPRISONED IN THE FORTRESS WHEN THE SLAVE CAME BACK TO ROC
libri-org_332-128985-0047 THE LETTER WAS GIVEN TO HIM WITH VERY PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH IT HE WAS TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND THEN IN THE NIGHT HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN
libri-org_332-128985-0048 AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
libri-org_332-128985-0049 THE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACE
libri-org_332-128985-0050 HAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MIND
libri-org_332-128985-0051 HE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERS
libri-org_332-128985-0052 AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
libri-org_332-128985-0053 IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATION
libri-org_332-128985-0054 AND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODS
libri-org_332-128985-0055 TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
libri-org_332-128985-0056 WAS THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF THE GOVERNOR NOW ROC AND HIS MEN WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WERE TOLD THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING COMMITTED NO OVERT ACT OF DISORDER THEY WOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY AND SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
libri-org_332-128985-0057 UPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
libri-org_332-128985-0058 THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
libri-org_332-128985-0059 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR BUCCANEERS WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN PUT ON BOARD THE FRENCH VESSEL BUT AS THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD STARTED HIS PRISONERS ON THE ROAD TO REFORM HE DID NOT WISH TO THROW THEM INTO THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
libri-org_332-128985-0060 BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
libri-org_332-128985-0061 ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
libri-org_332-128985-0062 WHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO GAMBLE TO GET DRUNK AND TO RUN AMUCK UP AND DOWN THE DECK BUT HE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM ALL THESE RECREATIONS AND SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE SUCH AN ABLE BODIED AND WILLING SAILOR
libri-org_332-128985-0063 THAT THE CAPTAIN ALLOWED HIM TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE CREW ROC KNEW HOW TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS NOT ONLY COULD HE MURDER AND ROB BUT HE KNEW HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF FILLING HIS PURSE HE HAD LEARNED AMONG THE INDIANS
libri-org_332-128985-0064 HOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSEL
libri-org_332-128985-0065 THESE FISH HE SOLD TO THE OFFICERS AND WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THIS WAY HE EARNED NO LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS PERHAPS THAT MANY DOLLARS IF THIS ACCOUNT IS TRUE FISH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY COSTLY IN THOSE DAYS
libri-org_332-128985-0066 IN EVERY WAY ROC BEHAVED SO WELL THAT FOR HIS SAKE ALL HIS MEN WERE TREATED KINDLY AND ALLOWED MANY PRIVILEGES BUT WHEN THIS PARTY OF REFORMED PIRATES REACHED SPAIN AND WERE ALLOWED TO GO WHERE THEY PLEASED
libri-org_332-128985-0067 THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFT
libri-org_332-128985-0068 BUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICA
libri-org_332-128985-0069 NOT ONLY DID ROC CAST FROM HIM EVERY THOUGHT OF REFORMATION AND A RESPECTABLE LIFE BUT HE DETERMINED TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY ON A GRANDER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE HE MADE A COMPACT WITH AN OLD FRENCH BUCCANEER
libri-org_332-128985-0070 AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
libri-org_332-128985-0071 OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
libri-org_332-128985-0072 FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
libri-org_332-128985-0073 IN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COAST
libri-org_332-128985-0074 IF THEY COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO RUSH UPON THE UNSUSPECTING GARRISON AND HAVING ANNIHILATED THESE MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE TOWN BUT THEIR PLANS DID NOT WORK VERY WELL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY SOME INDIANS
libri-org_332-128985-0075 AFTER THEY HAD LANDED WHO HURRIED TO MERIDA AND GAVE NOTICE OF THE APPROACH OF THE BUCCANEERS CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ROC AND HIS COMPANIONS REACHED THE TOWN THEY FOUND THE GARRISON PREPARED FOR THEM CANNONS LOADED AND ALL THE APPROACHES GUARDED
libri-org_332-128985-0076 STILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEA
libri-org_332-128985-0077 IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
libri-org_332-128985-0078 AND THEY WERE THEREFORE GREATLY DISMAYED WHEN A PARTY OF HORSEMEN FROM THE TOWN WHO HAD MADE A WIDE DETOUR THROUGH THE WOODS SUDDENLY CHARGED UPON THEIR REAR
libri-org_332-128985-0079 TRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELING
libri-org_332-128985-0080 WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ON MERIDA AND WHO WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO BE CALLED UPON TO RECORD THAT HIS GREAT HERO ROC THE BRAZILIAN SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS
libri-org_332-128985-0081 BY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOOD
libri-org_332-128985-0082 COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
libri-org_332-128985-0083 WHO WOULD EVEN SURRENDER TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING AWAY THAT ESQUEMELING COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT ROC HAD RETREATED FROM HIS ENEMIES DESERTED HIS FRIENDS AND TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS SO TRUCULENTLY PROCLAIMED
libri-org_332-128985-0084 BUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITY
libri-org_332-128985-0085 THE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATE
libri-org_332-128985-0086 UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALL THOSE BRAVE AND SAVAGE QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING ESTEEMED AND REVERED AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED THOSE OTHER QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING DESPISED
libri-org_332-128985-0087 BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREER
libri-org_332-128985-0088 AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
libri-org_3526-176653-0000 THE FERNS DRENCHED HIS STIRRUPS AS HE BRUSHED THROUGH THEM AND EACH DRIPPING TREE TOP BROKE THE SUNLIGHT AND LET IT DROP IN TENT LIKE BEAMS THROUGH THE SHIMMERING UNDERMIST A BIRD FLASHED HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE GREEN GLOOM
libri-org_3526-176653-0001 BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE AIR BUT THE FOOTFALLS OF HIS HORSE AND THE EASY CREAKING OF LEATHER UNDER HIM THE DRIP OF DEW OVERHEAD AND THE RUNNING OF WATER BELOW NOW AND THEN HE COULD SEE THE SAME SLENDER FOOT PRINTS IN THE RICH LOAM
libri-org_3526-176653-0002 AND HE SAW THEM IN THE SAND WHERE THE FIRST TINY BROOK TINKLED ACROSS THE PATH FROM A GLOOMY RAVINE THERE THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD TAKEN A FLYING LEAP ACROSS IT AND BEYOND HE COULD SEE THE PRINTS NO MORE HE LITTLE GUESSED THAT WHILE HE HALTED TO LET HIS HORSE DRINK
libri-org_3526-176653-0003 HE TURNED BACK UP THE CREEK AND PASSED SO CLOSE TO WHERE SHE HAD SLIPPED ASIDE INTO THE BUSHES THAT SHE CAME NEAR SHRIEKING BUT HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON A POOL OF THE CREEK ABOVE AND TO HER WONDER HE STROLLED STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER WITH HIS BOOTS ON
libri-org_3526-176653-0004 PUSHING THE NET IN FRONT OF HIM HE WAS A RAIDER SURE SHE THOUGHT NOW AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A MOONSHINE STILL AND THE WILD LITTLE THING IN THE BUSHES SMILED CUNNINGLY THERE WAS NO STILL UP THAT CREEK
libri-org_3526-176653-0005 AND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE AND
libri-org_3526-176653-0006 HER EYES GOT BIG WITH WONDER TAKE IT TO PIECES AND MAKE IT INTO A LONG LIMBER ROD IN A MOMENT HE HAD CAST A MINNOW INTO THE POOL AND WADED OUT INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS HIPS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO QUEER A FISHING POLE SO QUEER A FISHERMAN
libri-org_3526-176653-0007 HOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A SLIGHT JERK AND A SHINING FISH FLOPPED TWO FEET INTO THE AIR IT WAS SURELY VERY QUEER
libri-org_3526-176653-0008 BUT STOOD STILL WINDING SOMETHING WITH ONE HAND AND AGAIN THE FISH WOULD FLASH INTO THE AIR AND THEN THAT HUMMING WOULD START AGAIN WHILE THE FISHERMAN WOULD STAND QUIET AND WAITING FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO WIND AGAIN IN HER WONDER
libri-org_3526-176653-0009 DROWNING HIM STEPPING BACKWARD AT THE SAME TIME AND A MOMENT LATER THE FISH SLID EASILY OUT OF THE EDGE OF THE WATER GASPING ALONG THE EDGE OF A LOW SAND BANK AND THE FISHERMAN REACHING DOWN WITH ONE HAND CAUGHT HIM IN THE GILLS THEN
libri-org_3526-176653-0010 HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AND SHE HAD SEEN NO SMILE LIKE THAT BEFORE HOWDYE LITTLE GIRL ONE BARE TOE WENT BURROWING SUDDENLY INTO THE SAND ONE FINGER WENT TO HER RED MOUTH AND THAT WAS ALL
libri-org_3526-176653-0011 AND HE SMILED AGAIN CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE HER EYES FELL AT THE ANCIENT BANTER BUT SHE LIFTED THEM STRAIGHTWAY AND STARED AGAIN YOU LIVE AROUND HERE SHE STARED ON
libri-org_3526-176653-0012 WHERE NO ANSWER WHAT'S YOUR NAME LITTLE GIRL AND STILL SHE STARED
libri-org_3526-176653-0013 THE STEADY EYES LEAPED ANGRILY BUT THERE WAS STILL NO ANSWER AND HE BENT TO TAKE THE FISH OFF HIS HOOK PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW TURNED HIS BACK AND TOSSED IT INTO THE POOL HIT HAIN'T HE LOOKED UP AGAIN
libri-org_3526-176653-0014 HIS LINE RANG SUDDENLY JACK SHE CRIED YOU GOT A BITE HE PULLED MISSED THE STRIKE AND WOUND IN THE MINNOW WAS ALL RIGHT SO HE TOSSED IT BACK AGAIN THAT ISN'T YOUR NAME HE SAID
libri-org_3526-176653-0015 HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY A LONG CRY CAME DOWN THE RAVINE
libri-org_3526-176653-0016 AND THE FISHERMAN WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD ARIGHT JUNE THE LITTLE GIRL GAVE A SHRILL ANSWERING CRY BUT SHE DID NOT MOVE THAR NOW SHE SAID WHO'S THAT YOUR MAMMY NO TAIN'T
libri-org_3526-176653-0017 HIT'S MY STEP MAMMY I'M A GOIN TO KETCH HELL NOW HER INNOCENT EYES TURNED SULLEN AND HER BABY MOUTH TIGHTENED GOOD LORD SAID THE FISHERMAN STARTLED AND THEN HE STOPPED THE WORDS WERE AS INNOCENT ON HER LIPS AS A BENEDICTION
libri-org_3526-176653-0018 HAVE YOU GOT A FATHER LIKE A FLASH HER WHOLE FACE CHANGED
libri-org_3526-176653-0019 DRAWLED A VOICE FROM THE BUSHES AND IT HAD A TONE THAT MADE THE FISHERMAN WHIRL SUDDENLY A GIANT MOUNTAINEER STOOD ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH A WINCHESTER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM HOW ARE YOU
libri-org_3526-176653-0020 THE GIANT'S HEAVY EYES LIFTED QUICKLY BUT HE SPOKE TO THE GIRL YOU GO ON HOME
libri-org_3526-176653-0021 THE GIRL SHRANK TO THE BUSHES BUT SHE CRIED SHARPLY BACK DON'T YOU HURT HIM NOW DAD HE AIN'T EVEN GOT A PISTOL HE AIN'T NO SHET UP
libri-org_3526-176653-0022 THE LITTLE CREATURE VANISHED AND THE MOUNTAINEER TURNED TO THE FISHERMAN WHO HAD JUST PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW AND TOSSED IT INTO THE RIVER PURTY WELL THANK YOU HE SAID SHORTLY HOW ARE YOU FINE WAS THE NONCHALANT ANSWER
libri-org_3526-176653-0023 FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS SILENCE AND A PUZZLED FROWN GATHERED ON THE MOUNTAINEER'S FACE THAT'S A BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL OF YOURS
libri-org_3526-176653-0024 NO NOT IN THESE MOUNTAINS WHY THE FISHERMAN LOOKED AROUND AND WAS ALMOST STARTLED BY THE FIERCE GAZE OF HIS QUESTIONER STOP THAT PLEASE HE SAID WITH A HUMOUROUS SMILE YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS
libri-org_3526-176653-0025 THE MOUNTAINEER'S BUSHY BROWS CAME TOGETHER ACROSS THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE AND HIS VOICE RUMBLED LIKE DISTANT THUNDER WHAT'S YO NAME STRANGER AN WHAT'S YO BUSINESS OVER HYEH DEAR ME THERE YOU GO YOU CAN SEE I'M FISHING

libri-org_3526-176653-0043 LEFT HIS MINNOW BUCKET WHERE IT WAS MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE UP THE PATH ABOUT HIM THE BEECH LEAVES GAVE BACK THE GOLD OF THE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE RAVINE HIGH UNDER THE CREST OF THE MOTTLED MOUNTAIN WAS ON FIRE WITH THE SCARLET OF MAPLE
libri-org_3526-176653-0044 WHEN HE GOT TO THE BARE CREST OF A LITTLE RISE HE COULD SEE UP THE CREEK A SPIRAL OF BLUE RISING SWIFTLY FROM A STONE CHIMNEY GEESE AND DUCKS WERE HUNTING CRAWFISH IN THE LITTLE CREEK THAT RAN FROM A MILK HOUSE OF LOGS
libri-org_3526-176653-0045 HALF HIDDEN BY WILLOWS AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND A TURN IN THE PATH BROUGHT INTO VIEW A LOG CABIN WELL CHINKED WITH STONES AND PLASTER AND WITH A WELL BUILT PORCH A FENCE RAN AROUND THE YARD
libri-org_3526-176653-0046 GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
libri-org_3526-176653-0047 STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
libri-org_3526-176653-0048 IN THE ROAD ACROSS THE CREEK WAS A CHUBBY TOW HAIRED BOY WITH A LONG SWITCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND A PINE DAGGER AND A STRING IN HIS LEFT ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND TIED BY ONE HIND LEG WAS A FROG
libri-org_3526-176653-0049 THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
libri-org_3526-176653-0050 GEE GEE THE FROG HOPPED SEVERAL TIMES
libri-org_3526-176653-0051 SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW PANTING IN SYMPATHY
libri-org_3526-176653-0052 THEN HE LOOKED UP FOR AN INSTANT HE SEEMED TERRIFIED BUT HE DID NOT RUN INSTEAD HE STEALTHILY SHIFTED THE PINE DAGGER OVER TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE STRING TO HIS LEFT HERE BOY SAID THE FISHERMAN WITH AFFECTED STERNNESS
libri-org_3526-176653-0053 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DAGGER THE BOY'S BREAST HEAVED AND HIS DIRTY FINGERS CLENCHED TIGHT AROUND THE WHITTLED STICK DON'T YOU TALK TO ME THAT A WAY HE SAID WITH AN OMINOUS SHAKE OF HIS HEAD I'LL GUT YE THE FISHERMAN THREW BACK HIS HEAD
libri-org_3526-176653-0054 AND HIS PEAL OF LAUGHTER DID WHAT HIS STERNNESS FAILED TO DO THE LITTLE FELLOW WHEELED SUDDENLY AND HIS FEET SPURNED THE SAND AROUND THE BUSHES FOR HOME THE ASTONISHED FROG DRAGGED BUMPING AFTER HIM WELL
libri-org_3664-178355-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN CHAMPION BUFFALO KILLER SHORTLY AFTER THE ADVENTURES MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER I HAD MY CELEBRATED BUFFALO HUNT WITH BILLY COMSTOCK A NOTED SCOUT GUIDE AND INTERPRETER
libri-org_3664-178355-0001 WHO WAS THEN CHIEF OF SCOUTS AT FORT WALLACE KANSAS COMSTOCK HAD THE REPUTATION FOR A LONG TIME OF BEING A MOST SUCCESSFUL BUFFALO HUNTER AND THE OFFICERS IN PARTICULAR WHO HAD SEEN HIM KILL BUFFALOES WERE VERY DESIROUS OF BACKING HIM IN A MATCH AGAINST ME
libri-org_3664-178355-0002 IT WAS ACCORDINGLY ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD SHOOT HIM A BUFFALO KILLING MATCH AND THE PRELIMINARIES WERE EASILY AND SATISFACTORILY AGREED UPON WE WERE TO HUNT ONE DAY OF EIGHT HOURS BEGINNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND CLOSING AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
libri-org_3664-178355-0003 THE WAGER WAS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A SIDE AND THE MAN WHO SHOULD KILL THE GREATER NUMBER OF BUFFALOES FROM ON HORSEBACK WAS TO BE DECLARED THE WINNER THE HUNT TOOK PLACE ABOUT TWENTY MILES EAST OF SHERIDAN AND AS IT HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL ADVERTISED AND NOISED ABROAD
libri-org_3664-178355-0004 A LARGE CROWD WITNESSED THE INTERESTING AND EXCITING SCENE AN EXCURSION PARTY MOSTLY FROM SAINT LOUIS CONSISTING OF ABOUT A HUNDRED GENTLEMEN AND LADIES CAME OUT ON A SPECIAL TRAIN TO VIEW THE SPORT AND AMONG THE NUMBER WAS MY WIFE WITH LITTLE BABY ARTA
libri-org_3664-178355-0005 THE BUFFALOES WERE QUITE PLENTY AND IT WAS AGREED THAT WE SHOULD GO INTO THE SAME HERD AT THE SAME TIME AND MAKE A RUN AS WE CALLED IT EACH ONE KILLING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE A REFEREE WAS TO FOLLOW EACH OF US ON HORSEBACK WHEN WE ENTERED THE HERD AND COUNT THE BUFFALOES KILLED BY EACH MAN
libri-org_3664-178355-0006 WHEN THEY WERE TO COME UP AS NEAR AS THEY PLEASED AND WITNESS THE CHASE WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THE FIRST RUN IN GETTING GOOD GROUND COMSTOCK WAS MOUNTED ON ONE OF HIS FAVORITE HORSES WHILE I RODE OLD BRIGHAM I FELT CONFIDENT THAT I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF COMSTOCK IN TWO THINGS
libri-org_3664-178355-0007 FIRST I HAD THE BEST BUFFALO HORSE THAT EVER MADE A TRACK AND SECOND I WAS USING WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE NEEDLE GUN A BREECH LOADING SPRINGFIELD RIFLE CALIBRE FIFTY IT WAS MY FAVORITE OLD LUCRETIA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF THE READER
libri-org_3664-178355-0008 WHILE COMSTOCK WAS ARMED WITH A HENRY RIFLE AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD FIRE A FEW SHOTS QUICKER THAN I COULD YET I WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT DID NOT CARRY POWDER AND LEAD ENOUGH TO DO EXECUTION EQUAL TO MY CALIBRE FIFTY AT LAST THE TIME CAME TO BEGIN THE MATCH
libri-org_3664-178355-0009 COMSTOCK AND I DASHED INTO A HERD FOLLOWED BY THE REFEREES THE BUFFALOES SEPARATED COMSTOCK TOOK THE LEFT BUNCH AND I THE RIGHT MY GREAT FORTE IN KILLING BUFFALOES FROM HORSEBACK WAS TO GET THEM CIRCLING BY RIDING MY HORSE AT THE HEAD OF THE HERD SHOOTING THE LEADERS
libri-org_3664-178355-0010 TILL THEY WOULD FINALLY CIRCLE ROUND AND ROUND ON THIS MORNING THE BUFFALOES WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING
libri-org_3664-178355-0011 I HAD NURSED MY BUFFALOES AS A BILLIARD PLAYER DOES THE BALLS WHEN HE MAKES A BIG RUN AFTER THE RESULT OF THE FIRST RUN HAD BEEN DULY ANNOUNCED OUR SAINT LOUIS EXCURSION FRIENDS WHO HAD APPROACHED TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD STOPPED SET OUT A LOT OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
libri-org_3664-178355-0012 AND WHICH PROVED A GOOD DRINK ON A KANSAS PRAIRIE AND A BUFFALO HUNTER WAS A GOOD MAN TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHILE TAKING A SHORT REST WE SUDDENLY SPIED ANOTHER HERD OF BUFFALOES COMING TOWARD US IT WAS ONLY A SMALL DROVE AND WE AT ONCE PREPARED TO GIVE THE ANIMALS A LIVELY RECEPTION
libri-org_3664-178355-0013 THEY PROVED TO BE A HERD OF COWS AND CALVES WHICH BY THE WAY ARE QUICKER IN THEIR MOVEMENTS THAN THE BULLS WE CHARGED IN AMONG THEM AND I CONCLUDED MY RUN WITH A SCORE OF EIGHTEEN WHILE COMSTOCK KILLED FOURTEEN
libri-org_3664-178355-0014 WE CAME UP CLOSE TO ANOTHER HERD AS I WAS SO FAR AHEAD OF MY COMPETITOR IN THE NUMBER KILLED I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO GIVE AN EXTRA EXHIBITION OF MY SKILL I HAD TOLD THE LADIES THAT I WOULD ON THE NEXT RUN RIDE MY HORSE WITHOUT SADDLE OR BRIDLE
libri-org_3664-178355-0015 AND I REMEMBER ONE FAIR LADY WHO ENDEAVORED TO PREVAIL UPON ME NOT TO ATTEMPT IT THAT'S NOTHING AT ALL SAID I I HAVE DONE IT MANY A TIME AND OLD BRIGHAM KNOWS AS WELL AS I WHAT I AM DOING AND SOMETIMES A GREAT DEAL BETTER SO LEAVING MY SADDLE AND BRIDLE WITH THE WAGONS
libri-org_3664-178355-0016 WE RODE TO THE WINDWARD OF THE BUFFALOES AS USUAL AND WHEN WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF THEM WE DASHED INTO THE HERD I SOON HAD THIRTEEN LAID OUT ON THE GROUND THE LAST ONE OF WHICH I HAD DRIVEN DOWN CLOSE TO THE WAGONS WHERE THE LADIES WERE
libri-org_3664-178355-0017 IT FRIGHTENED SOME OF THE TENDER CREATURES TO SEE THE BUFFALO COMING AT FULL SPEED DIRECTLY TOWARD THEM BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF ONE OF THE WAGONS I SHOT HIM DEAD IN HIS TRACKS THIS MADE MY SIXTY NINTH BUFFALO AND FINISHED MY THIRD AND LAST RUN
libri-org_3664-178355-0018 COMSTOCK HAVING KILLED FORTY SIX AS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON COMSTOCK AND HIS BACKERS GAVE UP THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BEAT ME AND THEREUPON THE REFEREES DECLARED ME THE WINNER OF THE MATCH
libri-org_3664-178355-0019 THEY PREPARED TO DEPART HAVING DECLINED AN INVITATION TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE
libri-org_3664-178355-0020 HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE INDIANS WHO OVERTOOK HIM AND HIS COMPANION WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT HALF A MILE AFTER SURROUNDING THE TWO MEN THEY SUDDENLY ATTACKED THEM THEY KILLED SCALPED AND ROBBED COMSTOCK BUT GROVER ALTHOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED MADE HIS ESCAPE
libri-org_3664-178355-0021 OWING TO THE FLEETNESS OF THE EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS RIDING THIS SAD EVENT OCCURRED AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ON OUR WAY BACK TO CAMP WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE CHOICE MEAT AND FINEST HEADS
libri-org_3664-178355-0022 IN THIS CONNECTION IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF PLACE TO STATE THAT DURING THE TIME I WAS HUNTING FOR THE KANSAS PACIFIC I ALWAYS BROUGHT INTO CAMP THE BEST BUFFALO HEADS AND TURNED THEM OVER TO THE COMPANY WHO FOUND A VERY GOOD USE FOR THEM THEY HAD THEM MOUNTED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MANNER
libri-org_3664-178355-0023 AND SENT THEM TO ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES AND RAILROAD CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVING THEM PLACED IN PROMINENT POSITIONS AT THE LEADING HOTELS DEPOTS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS AS A SORT OF TRADE MARK OR ADVERTISEMENT OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD
libri-org_3664-178355-0024 AND TO DAY THEY ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE TRAVELER ALMOST EVERYWHERE WHENEVER I AM TRAVELING OVER THE COUNTRY AND SEE ONE OF THESE TRADE MARKS I FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN THAT I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF THE OLD FELLOW WHOSE BODY IT ONCE ORNAMENTED
libri-org_3664-178355-0025 MY SERVICES AS A HUNTER WERE NOT ANY LONGER REQUIRED AT THIS TIME THERE WAS A GENERAL INDIAN WAR RAGING ALL ALONG THE WESTERN BORDERS GENERAL SHERIDAN HAD TAKEN UP HIS HEADQUARTERS AT FORT HAYES IN ORDER TO BE IN THE FIELD TO SUPERINTEND THE CAMPAIGN IN PERSON
libri-org_3664-178355-0026 AS SCOUTS AND GUIDES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND I CONCLUDED ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP MY OLD AVOCATION OF SCOUTING AND GUIDING FOR THE ARMY HAVING NO SUITABLE PLACE IN WHICH TO LEAVE MY OLD AND FAITHFUL BUFFALO HUNTER BRIGHAM AND NOT WISHING TO KILL HIM BY SCOUTING
libri-org_3664-178355-0027 I DETERMINED TO DISPOSE OF HIM I WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO PART WITH HIM BUT I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO RECEIVE HARDER USAGE IN OTHER HANDS THAN HE HAD IN MINE I HAD SEVERAL GOOD OFFERS TO SELL HIM
libri-org_3664-178355-0028 BUT AT THE SUGGESTION OF SOME GENTLEMEN IN SHERIDAN ALL OF WHOM WERE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE HORSE I PUT HIM UP AT A RAFFLE IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM ALL AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BECOMING THE OWNER OF THE FAMOUS STEED THERE WERE TEN CHANCES AT THIRTY DOLLARS EACH AND THEY WERE ALL QUICKLY TAKEN
libri-org_3664-178355-0029 A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSE
libri-org_3664-178355-0030 EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT MISTER BONHAM WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS TO RIDE THAT POKY LOOKING PLUG AGAINST THE FIVE THOROUGHBREDS WHICH WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE RACE WHEN ALL THE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN AND OFF WENT THE HORSES FOR WYANDOTTE
libri-org_3664-178355-0031 FOR THE FIRST HALF MILE SEVERAL OF THE HORSES LED BRIGHAM BUT ON THE SECOND MILE HE BEGAN PASSING THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND ON THE THIRD MILE HE WAS IN ADVANCE OF THEM ALL AND WAS SHOWING THEM ALL THE ROAD AT A LIVELY RATE ON THE FOURTH MILE HIS RIDER LET HIM OUT
libri-org_3664-178355-0032 AND ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL THE HOME STATION IN WYANDOTTE A LONG WAY AHEAD OF HIS FASTEST COMPETITOR EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AS WELL AS DISGUSTED THAT SUCH A HOMELY CRITTER SHOULD BE THE WINNER BRIGHAM OF COURSE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED A WIDE REPUTATION
libri-org_3664-178355-0033 AND HIS NAME AND EXPLOITS HAD OFTEN APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND WHEN IT WAS LEARNED THAT THIS CRITTER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE IDENTICAL BUFFALO HUNTING BRIGHAM NEARLY THE WHOLE CROWD ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AND HAD THEY KNOWN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE RULED HIM OUT
libri-org_3664-178355-0034 I FINALLY LOST TRACK OF BRIGHAM AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM THREE YEARS AGO WHILE I WAS AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE I MET A MISTER WILCOX WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE OWNED BRIGHAM
libri-org_3664-178355-0035 ONLY A FEW MILES OUT OF TOWN THE NEXT DAY I RODE OUT WITH MISTER WILCOX AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE GALLANT OLD HORSE HE WAS COMFORTABLY CARED FOR IN MISTER WILCOX'S STABLE AND LOOKED THE SAME CLEVER PONY THAT HE ALWAYS WAS IT SEEMED AS IF HE ALMOST REMEMBERED ME
libri-org_3664-178355-0036 AND WHENEVER I AGAIN VISIT MEMPHIS I SHALL SURELY GO AND SEE BRIGHAM IF HE IS STILL ALIVE BUT TO RETURN TO THE THREAD OF MY NARRATIVE FROM WHICH I HAVE WANDERED
libri-org_3947-13262-0000 HE HAD COME SUDDENLY UPON HER AS HE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE AND HIS HEART HAD LEAPED UP AT THE SIGHT OF HER HE WALKED ALONG BY HER NOW REJOICING AFTER ALL IN A LITTLE MOMENT OF THIS EARTHLY LOVE HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT OF HIS LIFE I HAVE JUST BEEN OVER TO SEE VIRGINIA
libri-org_3947-13262-0001 SAID RACHEL SHE TELLS ME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NEARLY COMPLETED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE RECTANGLE PROPERTY YES IT HAS BEEN A TEDIOUS CASE IN THE COURTS DID VIRGINIA SHOW YOU ALL THE PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR BUILDING
libri-org_3947-13262-0002 WE LOOKED OVER A GOOD MANY IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME WHERE VIRGINIA HAS MANAGED TO GET ALL HER IDEAS ABOUT THIS WORK VIRGINIA KNOWS MORE NOW ABOUT ARNOLD TOYNBEE AND EAST END LONDON AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN AMERICA
libri-org_3947-13262-0003 THAN A GOOD MANY PROFESSIONAL SLUM WORKERS SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING NEARLY ALL SUMMER IN GETTING INFORMATION ROLLIN WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE AT EASE AS THEY TALKED OVER THIS COMING WORK OF HUMANITY IT WAS SAFE COMMON GROUND
libri-org_3947-13262-0004 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF YOU RACHEL SUDDENLY ASKED AND THEN HER FACE WARMED WITH ITS QUICK FLUSH OF TROPICAL COLOR AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ROLLIN OR TOO MUCH REGRET AT NOT SEEING HIM OFTENER
libri-org_3947-13262-0005 I HAVE BEEN BUSY REPLIED ROLLIN BRIEFLY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT PERSISTED RACHEL YOU SAY SO LITTLE
libri-org_3947-13262-0006 SHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH
libri-org_3947-13262-0007 I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO REACH THE MEN I ONCE KNEW AND WIN THEM INTO MORE USEFUL LIVES HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS IF HE WERE ALMOST AFRAID TO GO ON RACHEL DID NOT VENTURE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING
libri-org_3947-13262-0008 I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMPANY TO WHICH YOU AND VIRGINIA BELONG CONTINUED ROLLIN BEGINNING AGAIN I HAVE MADE THE PLEDGE TO DO AS I BELIEVE JESUS WOULD DO
libri-org_3947-13262-0009 AND IT IS IN TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING MY WORK THAT IS WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND VIRGINIA TOLD ME ABOUT THE OTHER IT SEEMS WONDERFUL TO THINK THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP THAT PLEDGE WITH US BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THE CLUB MEN
libri-org_3947-13262-0010 YOU HAVE ASKED ME A DIRECT QUESTION AND I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW REPLIED ROLLIN SMILING AGAIN YOU SEE I ASKED MYSELF AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE TENT YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE HURRIEDLY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE
libri-org_3947-13262-0011 WHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSS
libri-org_3947-13262-0012 DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
libri-org_3947-13262-0013 THE CHURCHES LOOK AFTER THE POOR MISERABLE CREATURES LIKE THOSE IN THE RECTANGLE THEY MAKE SOME EFFORT TO REACH THE WORKING MAN THEY HAVE A LARGE CONSTITUENCY AMONG THE AVERAGE SALARY EARNING PEOPLE THEY SEND MONEY AND MISSIONARIES TO THE FOREIGN HEATHEN
libri-org_3947-13262-0014 BUT THE FASHIONABLE DISSIPATED YOUNG MEN AROUND TOWN THE CLUB MEN ARE LEFT OUT OF ALL PLANS FOR REACHING AND CHRISTIANIZING AND YET NO CLASS OF PEOPLE NEED IT MORE I SAID TO MYSELF I KNOW THESE MEN THEIR GOOD AND THEIR BAD QUALITIES I HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM
libri-org_3947-13262-0015 I AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO
libri-org_3947-13262-0016 WHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWER
libri-org_3947-13262-0017 ROLLIN'S VOICE WAS SO LOW ON THIS LAST SENTENCE THAT RACHEL HAD DIFFICULTY IN HEARING HIM ABOVE THE NOISE AROUND THEM BUT SHE KNEW WHAT HE HAD SAID SHE WANTED TO ASK WHAT HIS METHODS WERE BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ASK HIM
libri-org_3947-13262-0018 HER INTEREST IN HIS PLAN WAS LARGER THAN MERE CURIOSITY ROLLIN PAGE WAS SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM AS IF HE WERE AN ENTIRELY NEW ACQUAINTANCE
libri-org_3947-13262-0019 THEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ON
libri-org_3947-13262-0020 RACHEL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT DAY AND ROLLIN COULD NOT SHE FINALLY BROKE A LONG SILENCE BY ASKING WHAT SHE HAD NOT FOUND WORDS FOR BEFORE
libri-org_3947-13262-0021 IN YOUR WORK WITH THE CLUB MEN WITH YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCES WHAT SORT OF RECEPTION DO THEY GIVE YOU HOW DO YOU APPROACH THEM WHAT DO THEY SAY ROLLIN WAS RELIEVED WHEN RACHEL SPOKE HE ANSWERED QUICKLY OH IT DEPENDS ON THE MAN
libri-org_3947-13262-0022 A GOOD MANY OF THEM THINK I AM A CRANK I HAVE KEPT MY MEMBERSHIP UP AND AM IN GOOD STANDING IN THAT WAY I TRY TO BE WISE AND NOT PROVOKE ANY UNNECESSARY CRITICISM BUT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THE MEN HAVE RESPONDED TO MY APPEAL
libri-org_3947-13262-0023 I COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE
libri-org_3947-13262-0024 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO I KEEP ASKING IT THE ANSWER COMES SLOWLY FOR I AM FEELING MY WAY SLOWLY ONE THING I HAVE FOUND OUT THE MEN ARE NOT FIGHTING SHY OF ME I THINK THAT IS A GOOD SIGN
libri-org_3947-13262-0025 ANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLING
libri-org_3947-13262-0026 ROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECH
libri-org_3947-13262-0027 WITH IT ALL SHE KNEW THERE WAS A DEEP UNDERLYING SERIOUSNESS WHICH FELT THE BURDEN OF THE CROSS EVEN WHILE CARRYING IT WITH JOY THE NEXT TIME SHE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A SWIFT FEELING OF JUSTICE DUE TO ROLLIN AND HIS NEW LIFE
libri-org_3947-13262-0028 DO YOU REMEMBER I REPROACHED YOU ONCE FOR NOT HAVING ANY PURPOSE WORTH LIVING FOR SHE ASKED WHILE HER BEAUTIFUL FACE SEEMED TO ROLLIN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER WHEN HE HAD WON SUFFICIENT SELF CONTROL TO LOOK UP I WANT TO SAY
libri-org_3947-13262-0029 I FEEL THE NEED OF SAYING IN JUSTICE TO YOU NOW THAT I HONOR YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE PROMISE YOU HAVE MADE AS YOU INTERPRET THE PROMISE THE LIFE YOU ARE LIVING IS A NOBLE ONE ROLLIN TREMBLED HIS AGITATION WAS GREATER THAN HE COULD CONTROL
libri-org_3947-13262-0030 RACHEL COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT THEY WALKED ALONG IN SILENCE AT LAST ROLLIN SAID I THANK YOU IT HAS BEEN WORTH MORE TO ME THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT HE LOOKED INTO HER FACE FOR ONE MOMENT
libri-org_3947-13262-0031 SHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELF
libri-org_3947-13262-0032 I AM BEGINNING TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LOVED BY A NOBLE MAN I SHALL LOVE ROLLIN PAGE AFTER ALL WHAT AM I SAYING RACHEL WINSLOW HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SHE ROSE AND WALKED BACK AND FORTH SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
libri-org_3947-13262-0033 NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
libri-org_3947-13262-0034 IT WAS INDEED A PART OF IT FOR IF SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOVE ROLLIN PAGE IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN MAN SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE THE OTHER NEVER WOULD HAVE MOVED HER TO THIS GREAT CHANGE
libri-org_3947-13262-0035 AND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAY
libri-org_3947-13262-0036 IN THAT HOPE HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK AS THE DAYS SPED ON AND AT NO TIME WAS HE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING AND SAVING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES THAN IN THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED THAT CHANCE MEETING WITH RACHEL WINSLOW
libri-org_3947-13262-0037 THE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED IT
libri-org_3947-13262-0038 BUT THE BUILDING OF HOUSES IN THE FIELD THE TRANSFORMING OF ITS BLEAK BARE ASPECT INTO AN ATTRACTIVE PARK ALL OF WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN HER PLAN WAS A WORK TOO LARGE TO BE COMPLETED THAT FALL AFTER SHE HAD SECURED THE PROPERTY
libri-org_3947-13262-0039 BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
libri-org_3947-13262-0040 OUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH WONDERS FOR HUMANITY IN A SHORT TIME AND HENRY MAXWELL GOING OVER TO THE SCENE OF THE NEW WORK ONE DAY AFTER A NOON HOUR WITH THE SHOP MEN WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE OUTWARDLY
libri-org_3947-13262-0041 YET HE WALKED HOME THOUGHTFULLY AND ON HIS WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE BY THE SALOON HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE RECTANGLE AFTER ALL
libri-org_3947-13262-0042 EVEN COUNTING VIRGINIA'S AND RACHEL'S WORK AND MISTER GRAY'S WHERE HAD IT ACTUALLY COUNTED IN ANY VISIBLE QUANTITY
libri-org_3947-13262-0043 OF COURSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE REDEMPTIVE WORK BEGUN AND CARRIED ON BY THE HOLY SPIRIT IN HIS WONDERFUL DISPLAYS OF POWER IN THE FIRST CHURCH AND IN THE TENT MEETINGS HAD HAD ITS EFFECT UPON THE LIFE OF RAYMOND
libri-org_3947-13262-0044 BUT AS HE WALKED PAST SALOON AFTER SALOON AND NOTED THE CROWDS GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THEM AS HE SAW THE WRETCHED DENS AS MANY AS EVER APPARENTLY
libri-org_3947-13262-0045 HE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISH
libri-org_3947-13262-0046 WAS NOT THE LIVING SOURCE OF NEARLY ALL THE HUMAN MISERY THEY SOUGHT TO RELIEVE UNTOUCHED AS LONG AS THE SALOONS DID THEIR DEADLY BUT LEGITIMATE WORK
libri-org_3947-13262-0047 WAS IT NOT A PRACTICAL WASTE OF BEAUTIFUL LIVES FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO THROW THEMSELVES INTO THIS EARTHLY HELL WHEN FOR EVERY SOUL RESCUED BY THEIR SACRIFICE THE SALOON MADE TWO MORE THAT NEEDED RESCUE HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION
libri-org_3947-13262-0048 IT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLE
libri-org_3947-13262-0049 HENRY MAXWELL WENT BACK TO HIS PARISH WORK THAT AFTERNOON WITH ADDED CONVICTIONS ON THE LICENSE BUSINESS BUT IF THE SALOON WAS A FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF THE LIFE OF RAYMOND NO LESS WAS THE FIRST CHURCH AND ITS LITTLE COMPANY OF DISCIPLES WHO HAD PLEDGED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO
libri-org_3947-13262-0050 HENRY MAXWELL STANDING AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE MOVEMENT WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE OF ITS POWER AS SOME ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE MIGHT HAVE DONE BUT RAYMOND ITSELF FELT THE TOUCH IN VERY MANY WAYS NOT KNOWING ALL THE REASONS FOR THE CHANGE
libri-org_3947-13262-0051 THE WINTER WAS GONE AND THE YEAR WAS ENDED THE YEAR WHICH HENRY MAXWELL HAD FIXED AS THE TIME DURING WHICH THE PLEDGE SHOULD BE KEPT TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO SUNDAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THAT ONE A YEAR AGO WAS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST REMARKABLE DAY THAT THE FIRST CHURCH EVER KNEW
libri-org_460-172359-0000 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
libri-org_460-172359-0001 THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
libri-org_460-172359-0002 AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
libri-org_460-172359-0003 WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
libri-org_460-172359-0004 TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
libri-org_460-172359-0005 EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
libri-org_460-172359-0006 IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
libri-org_460-172359-0007 I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
libri-org_460-172359-0008 WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
libri-org_460-172359-0009 AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
libri-org_460-172359-0010 THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
libri-org_460-172359-0011 AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
libri-org_460-172359-0012 IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
libri-org_460-172359-0013 ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
libri-org_460-172359-0014 THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
libri-org_460-172359-0015 AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
libri-org_460-172359-0016 AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
libri-org_460-172359-0017 THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
libri-org_460-172359-0018 AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
libri-org_460-172359-0019 YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
libri-org_460-172359-0020 WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
libri-org_460-172359-0021 THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
libri-org_460-172359-0022 AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
libri-org_460-172359-0023 THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
libri-org_460-172359-0024 I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
libri-org_460-172359-0025 THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
libri-org_460-172359-0026 EXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISES
libri-org_460-172359-0027 IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
libri-org_460-172359-0028 I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
libri-org_460-172359-0029 THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
libri-org_460-172359-0030 I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
libri-org_460-172359-0031 AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
libri-org_460-172359-0032 AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
libri-org_460-172359-0033 SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
libri-org_460-172359-0034 WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
libri-org_460-172359-0035 CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
libri-org_460-172359-0036 THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
libri-org_460-172359-0037 JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
libri-org_460-172359-0038 THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
libri-org_460-172359-0039 BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
libri-org_460-172359-0040 AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
libri-org_460-172359-0041 AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
libri-org_460-172359-0042 BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
libri-org_460-172359-0043 I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
libri-org_460-172359-0044 BUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILES
libri-org_460-172359-0045 TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
libri-org_460-172359-0046 THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
libri-org_460-172359-0047 THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
libri-org_460-172359-0048 UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
libri-org_460-172359-0049 IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
libri-org_460-172359-0050 I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
libri-org_460-172359-0051 AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
libri-org_460-172359-0052 A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
libri-org_460-172359-0053 AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
libri-org_460-172359-0054 AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
libri-org_460-172359-0055 EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
libri-org_460-172359-0056 AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
libri-org_460-172359-0057 AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
libri-org_460-172359-0058 A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
libri-org_460-172359-0059 WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
libri-org_460-172359-0060 THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
libri-org_460-172359-0061 ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
libri-org_460-172359-0062 THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
libri-org_460-172359-0063 HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
libri-org_460-172359-0064 AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
libri-org_460-172359-0065 SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
libri-org_460-172359-0066 AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
libri-org_460-172359-0067 JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
libri-org_460-172359-0068 FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
libri-org_460-172359-0069 AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
libri-org_460-172359-0070 BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
libri-org_460-172359-0071 THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
libri-org_460-172359-0072 I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
libri-org_460-172359-0073 A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
libri-org_460-172359-0074 ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
libri-org_460-172359-0075 AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
libri-org_460-172359-0076 AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
libri-org_460-172359-0077 LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
libri-org_460-172359-0078 I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
libri-org_460-172359-0079 IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
libri-org_460-172359-0080 HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
libri-org_460-172359-0081 YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
libri-org_460-172359-0082 THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
libri-org_460-172359-0083 AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
libri-org_460-172359-0084 JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
libri-org_460-172359-0085 I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
libri-org_460-172359-0086 THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
libri-org_460-172359-0087 THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
libri-org_460-172359-0088 SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
libri-org_460-172359-0089 HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
libri-org_460-172359-0090 A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
libri-org_460-172359-0091 BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
libri-org_460-172359-0092 ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
libri-org_460-172359-0093 AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
libri-org_460-172359-0094 YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
libri-org_460-172359-0095 THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
libri-org_460-172359-0096 AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
libri-org_460-172359-0097 AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
libri-org_460-172359-0098 JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
libri-org_460-172359-0099 THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
libri-org_4640-19188-0000 CHAPTER FOUR MINUS FIVE PLUS ONE
libri-org_4640-19188-0001 STILL GREAT AS WAS THIS OMNIPOTENCE A MURMUR AROSE

libri-org_4640-19188-0008 AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR NEIGHBORS SUICIDE IS MURDER THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOND HEADS THINK OF THE WHITE LOCKS
libri-org_4640-19188-0009 ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AND ON THE PANE THE QUIVERING SHADOW OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD THE AIR OF HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN WATCHING PERHAPS SHE IS THE MOTHER OF SOME ONE OF YOU
libri-org_4640-19188-0010 LET HIM FEEL AT EASE THE TASK HERE WILL BE PERFORMED ALL THE SAME WHEN ONE SUPPORTS ONE'S RELATIVES BY ONE'S TOIL ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO SACRIFICE ONE'S SELF

libri-org_4640-19188-0020 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD POOR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY
libri-org_4640-19188-0021 AND WHOSE PIPE YOU KNOW WAS OF MASTIC AND YELLOW CLAY HIS BREATHING WAS HOARSE HIS FACE LIVID HIS LIMBS FLACCID HIS BELLY PROMINENT HE SAID NOTHING IF YOU SPOKE TO HIM HE DID NOT ANSWER
libri-org_4640-19188-0022 HE IS DEAD HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NECKER HOSPITAL WHERE I SAW HIM I WAS HOUSE SURGEON IN THAT HOSPITAL
libri-org_4640-19188-0023 THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
libri-org_4640-19188-0024 STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MORTALITY AMONG ABANDONED CHILDREN IS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT I REPEAT IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN IT CONCERNS MOTHERS IT CONCERNS YOUNG GIRLS IT CONCERNS LITTLE CHILDREN
libri-org_4640-19188-0025 BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS WORLD THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS OF WHOM YOU MUST THINK YOU MUST NOT BE EGOISTS ALL DROPPED THEIR HEADS WITH A GLOOMY AIR
libri-org_4640-19188-0026 STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
libri-org_4640-19188-0027 HE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED HE WAS AN EGOIST MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKS
libri-org_4640-19188-0028 AND CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE AND WHICH IS TO SUFFERING WHAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS TO PLEASURE DESPAIR ALSO HAS ITS ECSTASY MARIUS HAD REACHED THIS POINT
libri-org_4640-19188-0029 HE BEHELD MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS BUT THIS MOVED HIM THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND ROUSED EVEN HIM
libri-org_4640-19188-0030 HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELF
libri-org_4640-19188-0031 IT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE FORTH
libri-org_4640-19188-0032 THIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE REIGNS DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO THEY OBEYED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED
libri-org_4640-19188-0033 AND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHIND
libri-org_4640-19188-0034 AND THEN A STRUGGLE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD REMAIN AND WHO SHOULD FIND REASONS FOR THE OTHERS NOT REMAINING THE GENEROUS QUARREL BEGAN AFRESH YOU HAVE A WIFE WHO LOVES YOU
libri-org_4640-19188-0035 DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
libri-org_4640-19188-0036 WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE
libri-org_4640-19188-0037 AND MARIUS STUPIDLY COUNTED THEM THERE WERE STILL FIVE OF THEM THEN HIS GLANCE DROPPED TO THE FOUR UNIFORMS AT THAT MOMENT A FIFTH UNIFORM FELL AS IF FROM HEAVEN UPON THE OTHER FOUR
libri-org_4640-19188-0038 THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
libri-org_4640-19188-0039 THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
libri-org_4640-19188-0040 AND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLE
libri-org_4680-16042-0000 IT WAS THE REFLECTION OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS BURNING IN THE CORINTHE BARRICADE MARIUS DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THAT RED LIGHT
libri-org_4680-16042-0001 HAD PRESERVED WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AT THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE ON HIS LEFT HE THRUST HIS HEAD FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOUR
libri-org_4680-16042-0002 WHICH CAST A BROAD CURTAIN OF SHADOW IN WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ENGULFED HE PERCEIVED SOME LIGHT ON THE PAVEMENT A BIT OF THE WINE SHOP AND BEYOND A FLICKERING LAMP WITHIN A SORT OF SHAPELESS WALL AND MEN CROUCHING DOWN WITH GUNS ON THEIR KNEES
libri-org_4680-16042-0003 ALL THIS WAS TEN FATHOMS DISTANT FROM HIM IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THE HOUSES WHICH BORDERED THE LANE ON THE RIGHT CONCEALED THE REST OF THE WINE SHOP THE LARGE BARRICADE AND THE FLAG FROM HIM
libri-org_4680-16042-0004 MARIUS HAD BUT A STEP MORE TO TAKE
libri-org_4680-16042-0005 FOLDED HIS ARMS AND FELL TO THINKING ABOUT HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT OF THAT HEROIC COLONEL PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD A SOLDIER WHO HAD GUARDED THE FRONTIER OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLIC
libri-org_4680-16042-0006 HIS COCKADE BLACKENED WITH POWDER HIS BROW FURROWED WITH HIS HELMET IN BARRACKS IN CAMP IN THE BIVOUAC
libri-org_4680-16042-0007 AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWENTY YEARS HAD RETURNED FROM THE GREAT WARS WITH A SCARRED CHEEK A SMILING COUNTENANCE TRANQUIL ADMIRABLE PURE AS A CHILD HAVING DONE EVERYTHING FOR FRANCE AND NOTHING AGAINST HER
libri-org_4680-16042-0008 TO OFFER HIS BREAST TO BAYONETS TO SHED HIS BLOOD TO SEEK THE ENEMY TO SEEK DEATH THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO WAGE WAR IN HIS TURN AND DESCEND TO THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS TO DESCEND WAS THE STREET
libri-org_4680-16042-0009 HE THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER'S SWORD WHICH HIS GRANDFATHER HAD SOLD TO A SECOND HAND DEALER AND WHICH HE HAD SO MOURNFULLY REGRETTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THAT CHASTE AND VALIANT SWORD HAD DONE WELL TO ESCAPE FROM HIM
libri-org_4680-16042-0010 AND TO DEPART IN WRATH INTO THE GLOOM THAT IF IT HAD THUS FLED IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS INTELLIGENT AND BECAUSE IT HAD FORESEEN THE FUTURE THAT IT HAD HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF THIS REBELLION THE WAR OF THE GUTTERS
libri-org_4680-16042-0011 BLOWS GIVEN AND RECEIVED IN THE REAR IT WAS BECAUSE COMING FROM MARENGO AND FRIEDLAND IT DID NOT WISH TO GO TO THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE IT WAS BECAUSE AFTER WHAT IT HAD DONE WITH THE FATHER IT DID NOT WISH TO DO THIS FOR THE SON
libri-org_4680-16042-0012 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IF THAT SWORD WERE THERE IF AFTER TAKING POSSESSION OF IT AT HIS FATHER'S PILLOW HE HAD DARED TO TAKE IT AND CARRY IT OFF FOR THIS COMBAT OF DARKNESS BETWEEN FRENCHMEN IN THE STREETS
libri-org_4680-16042-0013 IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE SCORCHED HIS HANDS AND BURST OUT AFLAME BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE THE SWORD OF THE ANGEL

libri-org_4680-16042-0019 IT MAKES ONE SEE CLEARLY TO BE NEAR DEATH THE VISION OF THE ACTION INTO WHICH HE FELT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS ON THE POINT OF ENTERING APPEARED TO HIM NO MORE AS LAMENTABLE BUT AS SUPERB

libri-org_4680-16042-0021 CIVIL WAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THERE A FOREIGN WAR IS NOT ALL WAR BETWEEN MEN WAR BETWEEN BROTHERS WAR IS QUALIFIED ONLY BY ITS OBJECT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FOREIGN OR CIVIL WAR
libri-org_4680-16042-0022 THERE IS ONLY JUST AND UNJUST WAR UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN THE GRAND HUMAN AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED WAR THAT AT LEAST WHICH IS THE EFFORT OF THE FUTURE WHICH IS HASTENING ON AGAINST THE PAST WHICH IS LAGGING IN THE REAR MAY BE NECESSARY

libri-org_4680-16042-0036 THERE IS NO ONE WHO HAS NOT NOTICED IT IN HIS OWN CASE THE SOUL AND THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF ITS UNITY COMPLICATED WITH UBIQUITY HAS A STRANGE APTITUDE FOR REASONING ALMOST COLDLY IN THE MOST VIOLENT EXTREMITIES
libri-org_4680-16042-0037 WITHOUT MOVING AND THERE WAS PERCEPTIBLE THAT QUASI SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE LAST STAGE OF EXPECTATION OVERHEAD AT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE THIRD STORY MARIUS DESCRIED A SORT OF SPECTATOR WHO APPEARED TO HIM TO BE SINGULARLY ATTENTIVE
libri-org_4680-16042-0038 THIS WAS THE PORTER WHO HAD BEEN KILLED BY LE CABUC BELOW BY THE LIGHTS OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS THRUST BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES THIS HEAD COULD BE VAGUELY DISTINGUISHED NOTHING COULD BE STRANGER IN THAT SOMBRE AND UNCERTAIN GLEAM
libri-org_4680-16042-0039 ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE MAN WHO WAS DEAD WAS SURVEYING THOSE WHO WERE ABOUT TO DIE A LONG TRAIL OF BLOOD WHICH HAD FLOWED FROM THAT HEAD DESCENDED IN REDDISH THREADS FROM THE WINDOW TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FIRST FLOOR
libri-org_5789-70653-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE INQUEST THE CORONER WHO FULLY REALIZED THAT FOR THAT ONE DAY OF HIS LIFE AS A PROVINCIAL SOLICITOR HE WAS LIVING IN THE GAZE OF THE WORLD HAD RESOLVED TO BE WORTHY OF THE FLEETING EMINENCE
libri-org_5789-70653-0001 HE WAS A LARGE MAN OF JOVIAL TEMPER WITH A STRONG INTEREST IN THE DRAMATIC ASPECTS OF HIS WORK AND THE NEWS OF MANDERSON'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION HAD MADE HIM THE HAPPIEST CORONER IN ENGLAND
libri-org_5789-70653-0002 THE COURT WAS HELD IN A LONG UNFURNISHED ROOM LATELY BUILT ONTO THE HOTEL AND INTENDED TO SERVE AS A BALL ROOM OR CONCERT HALL A REGIMENT OF REPORTERS WAS ENTRENCHED IN THE FRONT SEATS
libri-org_5789-70653-0003 AND THOSE WHO WERE TO BE CALLED ON TO GIVE EVIDENCE OCCUPIED CHAIRS TO ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE BEHIND WHICH THE CORONER SAT WHILE THE JURY IN DOUBLE ROW WITH PLASTERED HAIR AND A SPURIOUS EASE OF MANNER FLANKED HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE
libri-org_5789-70653-0004 AN UNDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE AND LISTENED IN AN AWED SILENCE TO THE OPENING SOLEMNITIES THE NEWSPAPER MEN WELL USED TO THESE
libri-org_5789-70653-0005 THE IDENTITY OF THE DEAD MAN WAS PROVED BY HIS WIFE THE FIRST WITNESS CALLED FROM WHOM THE CORONER AFTER SOME INQUIRY INTO THE HEALTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DECEASED
libri-org_5789-70653-0006 PROCEEDED TO DRAW AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND ALIVE MISSUS MANDERSON WAS TAKEN THROUGH HER EVIDENCE BY THE CORONER
libri-org_5789-70653-0007 WITH THE SYMPATHY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT FOR THAT DARK FIGURE OF GRIEF SHE LIFTED HER THICK VEIL BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AND THE EXTREME PALENESS AND UNBROKEN COMPOSURE OF THE LADY
libri-org_5789-70653-0008 PRODUCED A SINGULAR IMPRESSION THIS WAS NOT AN IMPRESSION OF HARDNESS INTERESTING FEMININITY WAS THE FIRST THING TO BE FELT IN HER PRESENCE SHE WAS NOT EVEN ENIGMATIC
libri-org_5789-70653-0009 BUT HER VOICE WAS LOW AND CLEAR TO THE END HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD COME UP TO HIS BEDROOM ABOUT HIS USUAL HOUR FOR RETIRING ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT
libri-org_5789-70653-0010 HIS ROOM WAS REALLY A DRESSING ROOM ATTACHED TO HER OWN BEDROOM COMMUNICATING WITH IT BY A DOOR WHICH WAS USUALLY KEPT OPEN DURING THE NIGHT BOTH DRESSING ROOM AND BEDROOM WERE ENTERED BY OTHER DOORS GIVING ON THE PASSAGE
libri-org_5789-70653-0011 AND LIKED TO SLEEP IN A SMALL ROOM SHE HAD NOT BEEN AWAKE WHEN HE CAME UP BUT HAD BEEN HALF AROUSED AS USUALLY HAPPENED WHEN THE LIGHT WAS SWITCHED ON IN HER HUSBAND'S ROOM SHE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
libri-org_5789-70653-0012 SHE HAD NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AS SHE HAD BEEN VERY DROWSY AT THE TIME BUT SHE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR A MOONLIGHT RUN IN THE CAR
libri-org_5789-70653-0013 AND WHAT TIME IT WAS SHE HAD ASKED WHAT THE TIME WAS
libri-org_5789-70653-0014 HE DID EXPLAIN WHY I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE SHE STOPPED WITH A LITTLE APPEARANCE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE THE CORONER INSISTED GENTLY
libri-org_5789-70653-0015 HE SAID THAT MISTER MARLOWE COULD DO IT QUITE EASILY IF HE HAD NO ACCIDENT HE SAID THAT HE HAD STARTED IN THE CAR AND THEN WALKED BACK HOME A MILE OR SO AND FELT ALL THE BETTER FOR IT DID HE SAY ANY MORE
libri-org_5789-70653-0016 AND YOU HEARD NOTHING IN THE NIGHT NO I NEVER WOKE UNTIL MY MAID BROUGHT MY TEA IN THE MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LEADING TO MY HUSBAND'S ROOM AS SHE ALWAYS DID
libri-org_5789-70653-0017 AND I SUPPOSED HIM TO BE STILL THERE HE ALWAYS NEEDED A GREAT DEAL OF SLEEP HE SOMETIMES SLEPT UNTIL QUITE LATE IN THE MORNING I HAD BREAKFAST IN MY SITTING ROOM IT WAS ABOUT TEN WHEN I HEARD THAT MY HUSBAND'S BODY HAD BEEN FOUND
libri-org_5789-70653-0018 THE WITNESS DROPPED HER HEAD AND SILENTLY WAITED FOR HER DISMISSAL BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE YET MISSUS MANDERSON THE CORONER'S VOICE WAS SYMPATHETIC BUT IT HAD A HINT OF FIRMNESS IN IT NOW
libri-org_5789-70653-0019 THE QUESTION I AM GOING TO PUT TO YOU MUST IN THESE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES BE A PAINFUL ONE
libri-org_5789-70653-0020 IS IT THE FACT THAT YOUR RELATIONS WITH YOUR LATE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN FOR SOME TIME PAST RELATIONS OF MUTUAL AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE
libri-org_5789-70653-0021 HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME HAD GIVEN ME GREAT ANXIETY AND SORROW HE HAD CHANGED TOWARDS ME HE HAD BECOME VERY RESERVED AND SEEMED MISTRUSTFUL I SAW MUCH LESS OF HIM THAN BEFORE
libri-org_5789-70653-0022 HE SEEMED TO PREFER TO BE ALONE I CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION AT ALL OF THE CHANGE I TRIED TO WORK AGAINST IT I DID ALL I COULD WITH JUSTICE TO MY OWN DIGNITY AS I THOUGHT
libri-org_5789-70653-0023 SOMETHING WAS BETWEEN US I DID NOT KNOW WHAT AND HE NEVER TOLD ME MY OWN OBSTINATE PRIDE PREVENTED ME FROM ASKING WHAT IT WAS IN SO MANY WORDS
libri-org_5789-70653-0024 I ONLY MADE A POINT OF BEING TO HIM EXACTLY AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO FAR AS HE WOULD ALLOW ME I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW NOW WHAT IT WAS THE WITNESS WHOSE VOICE HAD TREMBLED IN SPITE OF HER SELF CONTROL
libri-org_5789-70653-0025 THEN WAS THERE NEVER ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY CALL WORDS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MA'AM NEVER
libri-org_5789-70653-0026 THE WORD WAS COLORLESSLY SPOKEN BUT EVERYONE FELT THAT A CRASS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF CONDUCT IN THE CASE OF A PERSON LIKE MISSUS MANDERSON HAD BEEN VISITED WITH SOME SEVERITY DID SHE KNOW THE CORONER ASKED
libri-org_5789-70653-0027 OF ANY OTHER MATTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREYING UPON HER HUSBAND'S MIND RECENTLY MISSUS MANDERSON KNEW OF NONE WHATEVER THE CORONER INTIMATED THAT HER ORDEAL WAS AT AN END AND THE VEILED LADY MADE HER WAY TO THE DOOR
libri-org_5789-70653-0028 THE GENERAL ATTENTION WHICH FOLLOWED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS NOW EAGERLY DIRECTED UPON MARTIN WHOM THE CORONER HAD PROCEEDED TO CALL IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT TRENT APPEARED AT THE DOORWAY AND EDGED HIS WAY INTO THE GREAT ROOM
libri-org_5789-70653-0029 BUT HE DID NOT LOOK AT MARTIN HE WAS OBSERVING THE WELL BALANCED FIGURE THAT CAME QUICKLY TOWARD HIM ALONG AN OPENING PATH IN THE CROWD AND HIS EYE WAS GLOOMY
libri-org_5789-70653-0030 HE STARTED AS HE STOOD ASIDE FROM THE DOOR WITH A SLIGHT BOW TO HEAR MISSUS MANDERSON ADDRESS HIM BY NAME IN A LOW VOICE HE FOLLOWED HER A PACE OR TWO INTO THE HALL I WANTED TO ASK YOU
libri-org_5789-70653-0031 SHE SAID IN A VOICE NOW WEAK AND ODDLY BROKEN IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR ARM A PART OF THE WAY TO THE HOUSE I COULD NOT SEE MY UNCLE NEAR THE DOOR AND I SUDDENLY FELT RATHER FAINT I SHALL BE BETTER IN THE AIR
libri-org_5789-70653-0032 SHE COULD DRAG HIM FROM THE PLACE THEN AGAIN SHE LEANED HEAVILY UPON IT AND WITH THAT SUPPORT AND WITH BENT HEAD SHE WALKED SLOWLY FROM THE HOTEL AND ALONG THE OAK SHADED PATH TOWARD WHITE GABLES
libri-org_5789-70653-0033 RUSHED THROUGH HIS BRAIN IN A ROUT BUT THE TOUCH OF HER UNNERVED HAND UPON HIS ARM NEVER FOR AN INSTANT LEFT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS FILLING HIM WITH AN EXALTATION THAT ENRAGED AND BEWILDERED HIM
libri-org_5789-70653-0034 HE WAS STILL CURSING HIMSELF FURIOUSLY BEHIND THE MASK OF CONVENTIONAL SOLICITUDE THAT HE TURNED TO THE LADY WHEN HE HAD ATTENDED HER TO THE HOUSE AND SEEN HER SINK UPON A COUCH IN THE MORNING ROOM
libri-org_5789-70653-0035 WITH A LOOK OF SINCERE GRATITUDE IN HER EYES SHE WAS MUCH BETTER NOW SHE SAID AND A CUP OF TEA WOULD WORK A MIRACLE UPON HER SHE HOPED SHE HAD NOT TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM ANYTHING IMPORTANT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HERSELF
libri-org_5789-70653-0036 SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD GO THROUGH WITH IT BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED THOSE LAST QUESTIONS I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT HEAR ME SHE SAID WHEN HE EXPLAINED BUT OF COURSE YOU WILL READ IT ALL IN THE REPORTS
libri-org_6272-70171-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IT WAS SUNSET WHEN WE ARRIVED IN ROSVILLE AND FOUND MISTER MORGESON WAITING FOR US WITH HIS CARRIAGE AT THE STATION FROM ITS OPEN SIDES
libri-org_6272-70171-0001 I LOOKED OUT ON A TRANQUIL AGREEABLE LANDSCAPE THERE WAS NOTHING SALINE IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE WESTERN BREEZE WHICH BLEW IN OUR FACES HAD AN EARTHY SCENT WITH FLUCTUATING STREAMS OF ODORS FROM TREES AND FLOWERS
libri-org_6272-70171-0002 AS WE PASSED THROUGH THE TOWN COUSIN CHARLES POINTED TO THE ACADEMY WHICH STOOD AT THE HEAD OF A GREEN PRETTY HOUSES STOOD ROUND IT AND STREETS BRANCHED FROM IT IN ALL DIRECTIONS FLOWER GARDENS SHRUBBERY AND TREES WERE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE
libri-org_6272-70171-0003 ROSVILLE WAS LARGER AND HANDSOMER THAN SURREY THAT IS MY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT HE SAID WE LOOKED DOWN THE SHADY STREET THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GOING
libri-org_6272-70171-0004 AND PEAKED ROOF AND ON THE SIDE TOWARD US A LARGE YARD AND STABLES WE DROVE INTO THE YARD AND A WOMAN CAME OUT ON THE PIAZZA TO RECEIVE US IT WAS MISSUS MORGESON OR MY WIFE COUSIN ALICE
libri-org_6272-70171-0005 AS MISTER MORGESON INTRODUCED HER GIVING US A CORDIAL WELCOME SHE LED US INTO A PARLOR WHERE TEA WAS WAITING A SERVANT CAME IN FOR OUR BONNETS AND BASKETS COUSIN ALICE BEGGED US TO TAKE TEA AT ONCE
libri-org_6272-70171-0006 WE WERE HARDLY SEATED WHEN WE HEARD THE CRY OF A YOUNG CHILD SHE LEFT THE TABLE HASTILY TO COME BACK IN A MOMENT WITH AN APOLOGY WHICH SHE MADE TO COUSIN CHARLES RATHER THAN TO US I HAD NEVER SEEN A TABLE SO WELL ARRANGED
libri-org_6272-70171-0007 SO FASTIDIOUSLY NEAT IT GLITTERED WITH GLASS AND FRENCH CHINA COUSIN CHARLES SENT AWAY A GLASS AND A PLATE FROWNING AT THE GIRL WHO WAITED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECK OR A FLAW IN THEM THE VIANDS WERE AS PRETTY AS THE DISHES
libri-org_6272-70171-0008 THE LAMB CHOPS WERE FRAGILE THE BREAD WAS DELICIOUS BUT CUT IN TRANSPARENT SLICES AND THE BUTTER PAT WAS NEARLY STAMPED THROUGH WITH ITS BOUQUET OF FLOWERS THIS WAS ALL THE FEAST EXCEPT SPONGE CAKE WHICH FELT LIKE MUSLIN IN THE FINGERS
libri-org_6272-70171-0009 I COULD HAVE SQUEEZED THE WHOLE OF IT INTO MY MOUTH STILL HUNGRY I OBSERVED THAT COUSIN CHARLES AND ALICE HAD FINISHED AND THOUGH SHE SHOOK HER SPOON IN THE CUP FEIGNING TO CONTINUE AND HE SNIPPED CRUMBS IN HIS PLATE
libri-org_6272-70171-0010 I FELT CONSTRAINED TO END MY REPAST HE ROSE THEN AND PUSHING BACK FOLDING DOORS WE ENTERED A LARGE ROOM LEAVING ALICE AT THE TABLE WINDOWS EXTENDING TO THE FLOOR OPENING ON THE PIAZZA
libri-org_6272-70171-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE STREAM OF LIGHT OVER THE CARPET I THOUGHT IT SOMBER AND OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE COTTAGE EXTERIOR
libri-org_6272-70171-0012 THE FURNITURE WAS DARK THE MANTEL AND TABLE TOPS WERE BLACK MARBLE AND THE VASES AND CANDELABRA WERE BRONZE HE DIRECTED MOTHER'S ATTENTION TO THE PORTRAITS OF HIS CHILDREN EXPLAINING THEM
libri-org_6272-70171-0013 DARK AND DELICATE BUT TO LOOK AT IT MADE ME SHIVER MOTHER CAME TOWARD US PLEADING FATIGUE AS AN EXCUSE FOR RETIRING AND COUSIN CHARLES CALLED COUSIN ALICE WHO WENT WITH US TO OUR ROOM IN THE MORNING SHE SAID
libri-org_6272-70171-0014 WE SHOULD SEE HER THREE CHILDREN SHE NEVER LEFT THEM SHE WAS SO AFRAID OF THEIR BEING ILL ALSO TELLING MOTHER THAT SHE WOULD DO ALL IN HER POWER TO MAKE MY STAY IN ROSVILLE PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE AS A MOTHER

libri-org_6272-70171-0024 I DREW FROM HER CONVERSATION THE OPINION THAT SHE HAD A TENDENCY TO THE REARING OF CHILDREN I WAS GLAD WHEN COUSIN CHARLES CAME IN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SEND OFF THE BABIES ALICE AND RING THE BELL FOR BREAKFAST SHE SENT OUT THE TWO YOUNGEST
libri-org_6272-70171-0025 PUT LITTLE EDWARD IN HIS CHAIR AND BREAKFAST BEGAN MISSUS MORGESON SAID CHARLES THE HORSES WILL BE READY TO TAKE YOU ROUND ROSVILLE WE WILL CALL ON DOCTOR PRICE FOR YOU TO SEE THE KIND OF MASTER CASSANDRA WILL HAVE I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT RECEIVING A NEW PUPIL

libri-org_6272-70171-0027 THE HAM WAS MOST SAVORY BUT CUT IN SUCH THIN SLICES THAT IT CURLED AND THE BISCUITS WERE AS WHITE AND FEATHERY AS SNOWFLAKES
libri-org_6272-70171-0028 COUSIN ALICE GAVE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EDWARD WHO ATE AS LITTLE AS THE REST MOTHER I SAID AFTERWARD

libri-org_7367-86737-0048 AND IT COST ME THREE THOUSAND FRANCS LET US HEAR THE HISTORY SAID FRANZ MOTIONING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO SEAT HIMSELF
libri-org_7367-86737-0049 AT THE MOMENT SIGNOR PASTRINI WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS MOUTH THAT YOU KNEW LUIGI VAMPA WHEN HE WAS A CHILD
libri-org_7367-86737-0050 A YOUNG MAN HE IS ONLY TWO AND TWENTY HE WILL GAIN HIMSELF A REPUTATION WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ALBERT AT TWO AND TWENTY TO BE THUS FAMOUS YES AND AT HIS AGE ALEXANDER CAESAR AND NAPOLEON
libri-org_7367-86737-0051 HE WAS BORN AT PAMPINARA AND ENTERED THE COUNT'S SERVICE WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER WAS ALSO A SHEPHERD WHO OWNED A SMALL FLOCK AND LIVED BY THE WOOL AND THE MILK WHICH HE SOLD AT ROME WHEN QUITE A CHILD THE LITTLE VAMPA DISPLAYED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY PRECOCITY
libri-org_7367-86737-0052 ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD HE CAME TO THE CURATE OF PALESTRINA AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT TO READ IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR HE COULD NOT QUIT HIS FLOCK BUT THE GOOD CURATE WENT EVERY DAY TO SAY MASS AT A LITTLE HAMLET TOO POOR TO PAY A PRIEST AND WHICH
libri-org_7367-86737-0053 EVERY DAY LUIGI LED HIS FLOCK TO GRAZE ON THE ROAD THAT LEADS FROM PALESTRINA TO BORGO EVERY DAY AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE PRIEST AND THE BOY SAT DOWN ON A BANK BY THE WAYSIDE
libri-org_7367-86737-0054 AT THE END OF A WEEK HE WROTE AS WELL WITH THIS PEN AS WITH THE STYLUS THE CURATE RELATED THE INCIDENT TO THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE WHO SENT FOR THE LITTLE SHEPHERD MADE HIM READ AND WRITE BEFORE HIM ORDERED HIS ATTENDANT TO LET HIM EAT WITH THE DOMESTICS AND TO GIVE HIM TWO PIASTRES A MONTH
libri-org_7367-86737-0055 WITH THIS LUIGI PURCHASED BOOKS AND PENCILS HE APPLIED HIS IMITATIVE POWERS TO EVERYTHING AND LIKE GIOTTO WHEN YOUNG HE DREW ON HIS SLATE SHEEP HOUSES AND TREES
libri-org_7367-86737-0056 IT WAS THUS THAT PINELLI THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR HAD COMMENCED A GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN THAT IS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN VAMPA TENDED SHEEP ON A FARM NEAR PALESTRINA SHE WAS AN ORPHAN BORN AT VALMONTONE AND WAS NAMED TERESA THE TWO CHILDREN MET
libri-org_7367-86737-0057 HAD BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ANY INFLUENCE OVER HIM OR EVEN TO BECOME HIS COMPANION HIS DISPOSITION ALWAYS INCLINED TO EXACT CONCESSIONS RATHER THAN TO MAKE THEM KEPT HIM ALOOF FROM ALL FRIENDSHIPS TERESA ALONE RULED BY A LOOK
libri-org_7367-86737-0058 THE TWO PIASTRES THAT LUIGI RECEIVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE'S STEWARD AND THE PRICE OF ALL THE LITTLE CARVINGS IN WOOD HE SOLD AT ROME WERE EXPENDED IN EAR RINGS NECKLACES AND GOLD HAIRPINS SO THAT THANKS TO HER FRIEND'S GENEROSITY
libri-org_7367-86737-0059 TERESA WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE BEST ATTIRED PEASANT NEAR ROME THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER PASSING ALL THEIR TIME WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVING THEMSELVES UP TO THE WILD IDEAS OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
libri-org_7367-86737-0060 THUS IN ALL THEIR DREAMS THEIR WISHES AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS VAMPA SAW HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN OF A VESSEL GENERAL OF AN ARMY OR GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE TERESA SAW HERSELF RICH SUPERBLY ATTIRED
libri-org_7367-86737-0061 AND ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF LIVERIED DOMESTICS THEN WHEN THEY HAD THUS PASSED THE DAY IN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR THEY SEPARATED THEIR FLOCKS AND DESCENDED FROM THE ELEVATION OF THEIR DREAMS TO THE REALITY OF THEIR HUMBLE POSITION
libri-org_7367-86737-0062 AND PROWL AROUND HIS FLOCK THE STEWARD GAVE HIM A GUN THIS WAS WHAT VAMPA LONGED FOR THIS GUN HAD AN EXCELLENT BARREL MADE AT BRESCHIA AND CARRYING A BALL WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ENGLISH RIFLE BUT ONE DAY THE COUNT BROKE THE STOCK
libri-org_7367-86737-0063 AND HAD THEN CAST THE GUN ASIDE THIS HOWEVER WAS NOTHING TO A SCULPTOR LIKE VAMPA HE EXAMINED THE BROKEN STOCK CALCULATED WHAT CHANGE IT WOULD REQUIRE TO ADAPT THE GUN TO HIS SHOULDER AND MADE A FRESH STOCK
libri-org_7367-86737-0064 SO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THAT IT WOULD HAVE FETCHED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PIASTRES HAD HE CHOSEN TO SELL IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME A GUN HAD BEEN THE YOUNG MAN'S GREATEST AMBITION IN EVERY COUNTRY WHERE INDEPENDENCE HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF LIBERTY
libri-org_7367-86737-0065 THE FIRST DESIRE OF A MANLY HEART IS TO POSSESS A WEAPON WHICH AT ONCE RENDERS HIM CAPABLE OF DEFENCE OR ATTACK AND BY RENDERING ITS OWNER TERRIBLE OFTEN MAKES HIM FEARED FROM THIS MOMENT VAMPA DEVOTED ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF HIS PRECIOUS WEAPON
libri-org_7367-86737-0066 HE PURCHASED POWDER AND BALL AND EVERYTHING SERVED HIM FOR A MARK THE TRUNK OF SOME OLD AND MOSS GROWN OLIVETREE THAT GREW ON THE SABINE MOUNTAINS THE FOX AS HE QUITTED HIS EARTH ON SOME MARAUDING EXCURSION THE EAGLE THAT SOARED ABOVE THEIR HEADS
libri-org_7367-86737-0067 AND THUS HE SOON BECAME SO EXPERT THAT TERESA OVERCAME THE TERROR SHE AT FIRST FELT AT THE REPORT AND AMUSED HERSELF BY WATCHING HIM DIRECT THE BALL WHEREVER HE PLEASED WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AS IF HE PLACED IT BY HAND
libri-org_7367-86737-0068 ONE EVENING A WOLF EMERGED FROM A PINE WOOD HEAR WHICH THEY WERE USUALLY STATIONED BUT THE WOLF HAD SCARCELY ADVANCED TEN YARDS ERE HE WAS DEAD PROUD OF THIS EXPLOIT VAMPA TOOK THE DEAD ANIMAL ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CARRIED HIM TO THE FARM
libri-org_7367-86737-0069 THESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUND
libri-org_7367-86737-0070 AND ALTHOUGH TERESA WAS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF THE SABINES NO ONE HAD EVER SPOKEN TO HER OF LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS BELOVED BY VAMPA AND YET THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD NEVER DECLARED THEIR AFFECTION
libri-org_7367-86737-0071 THEY HAD GROWN TOGETHER LIKE TWO TREES WHOSE ROOTS ARE MINGLED WHOSE BRANCHES INTERTWINED AND WHOSE INTERMINGLED PERFUME RISES TO THE HEAVENS ONLY THEIR WISH TO SEE EACH OTHER HAD BECOME A NECESSITY AND THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED DEATH TO A DAY'S SEPARATION
libri-org_7367-86737-0072 TERESA WAS SIXTEEN AND VAMPA SEVENTEEN
libri-org_7367-86737-0073 THE BRIGANDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME SOMETIMES A CHIEF IS WANTED BUT WHEN A CHIEF PRESENTS HIMSELF HE RARELY HAS TO WAIT LONG FOR A BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE CELEBRATED CUCUMETTO
libri-org_7367-86737-0074 DRIVEN OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES WHERE HE HAD CARRIED ON A REGULAR WAR HAD CROSSED THE GARIGLIANO LIKE MANFRED AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE ON THE BANKS OF THE AMASINE BETWEEN SONNINO AND JUPERNO
libri-org_7367-86737-0075 HE STROVE TO COLLECT A BAND OF FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECESARIS AND GASPERONE WHOM HE HOPED TO SURPASS MANY YOUNG MEN OF PALESTRINA FRASCATI AND PAMPINARA HAD DISAPPEARED
libri-org_7367-86737-0076 THEIR DISAPPEARANCE AT FIRST CAUSED MUCH DISQUIETUDE BUT IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT THEY HAD JOINED CUCUMETTO AFTER SOME TIME CUCUMETTO BECAME THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
libri-org_7367-86737-0077 THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TRAITS OF FEROCIOUS DARING AND BRUTALITY WERE RELATED OF HIM ONE DAY HE CARRIED OFF A YOUNG GIRL THE DAUGHTER OF A SURVEYOR OF FROSINONE THE BANDIT'S LAWS ARE POSITIVE A YOUNG GIRL BELONGS FIRST TO HIM WHO CARRIES HER OFF
libri-org_7367-86737-0078 THEN THE REST DRAW LOTS FOR HER AND SHE IS ABANDONED TO THEIR BRUTALITY UNTIL DEATH RELIEVES HER SUFFERINGS WHEN THEIR PARENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY RICH TO PAY A RANSOM A MESSENGER IS SENT TO NEGOTIATE THE PRISONER IS HOSTAGE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE MESSENGER
libri-org_7367-86737-0079 WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED HER LOVER THE POOR GIRL EXTENDED HER ARMS TO HIM AND BELIEVED HERSELF SAFE BUT CARLINI FELT HIS HEART SINK FOR HE BUT TOO WELL KNEW THE FATE THAT AWAITED HER HOWEVER AS HE WAS A FAVORITE WITH CUCUMETTO
libri-org_7367-86737-0080 AS HE HAD FOR THREE YEARS FAITHFULLY SERVED HIM AND AS HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE BY SHOOTING A DRAGOON WHO WAS ABOUT TO CUT HIM DOWN HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE PITY ON HIM HE TOOK CUCUMETTO ONE SIDE
libri-org_7367-86737-0081 WHILE THE YOUNG GIRL SEATED AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE PINE THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE FOREST MADE A VEIL OF HER PICTURESQUE HEAD DRESS TO HIDE HER FACE FROM THE LASCIVIOUS GAZE OF THE BANDITS THERE HE TOLD THE CHIEF ALL HIS AFFECTION FOR THE PRISONER
libri-org_7367-86737-0082 THEIR PROMISES OF MUTUAL FIDELITY AND HOW EVERY NIGHT SINCE HE HAD BEEN NEAR THEY HAD MET IN SOME NEIGHBORING RUINS
libri-org_7367-86737-0083 CUCUMETTO SEEMED TO YIELD TO HIS FRIEND'S ENTREATIES AND BADE HIM FIND A SHEPHERD TO SEND TO RITA'S FATHER AT FROSINONE CARLINI FLEW JOYFULLY TO RITA TELLING HER SHE WAS SAVED AND BIDDING HER WRITE TO HER FATHER TO INFORM HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
libri-org_7367-86737-0084 AND THAT HER RANSOM WAS FIXED AT THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES TWELVE HOURS DELAY WAS ALL THAT WAS GRANTED THAT IS UNTIL NINE THE NEXT MORNING THE INSTANT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN CARLINI SEIZED IT AND HASTENED TO THE PLAIN TO FIND A MESSENGER
libri-org_7367-86737-0085 HE FOUND A YOUNG SHEPHERD WATCHING HIS FLOCK THE NATURAL MESSENGERS OF THE BANDITS ARE THE SHEPHERDS WHO LIVE BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE MOUNTAINS BETWEEN CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE LIFE THE BOY UNDERTOOK THE COMMISSION PROMISING TO BE IN FROSINONE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
libri-org_7367-86737-0086 CARLINI RETURNED ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS MISTRESS AND ANNOUNCE THE JOYFUL INTELLIGENCE HE FOUND THE TROOP IN THE GLADE SUPPING OFF THE PROVISIONS EXACTED AS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PEASANTS BUT HIS EYE VAINLY SOUGHT RITA AND CUCUMETTO AMONG THEM
libri-org_7367-86737-0087 SAYING TO THE HEALTH OF THE BRAVE CUCUMETTO AND THE FAIR RITA AT THIS MOMENT CARLINI HEARD A WOMAN'S CRY HE DIVINED THE TRUTH SEIZED THE GLASS BROKE IT ACROSS THE FACE OF HIM WHO PRESENTED IT AND RUSHED TOWARDS THE SPOT
libri-org_7367-86737-0088 WHENCE THE CRY CAME AFTER A HUNDRED YARDS HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE THICKET HE FOUND RITA SENSELESS IN THE ARMS OF CUCUMETTO AT THE SIGHT OF CARLINI CUCUMETTO ROSE A PISTOL IN EACH HAND THE TWO BRIGANDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT
libri-org_7367-86737-0089 THE ONE WITH A SMILE OF LASCIVIOUSNESS ON HIS LIPS THE OTHER WITH THE PALLOR OF DEATH ON HIS BROW A TERRIBLE BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN SEEMED IMMINENT BUT BY DEGREES CARLINI'S FEATURES RELAXED HIS HAND WHICH HAD GRASPED ONE OF THE PISTOLS IN HIS BELT
libri-org_7367-86737-0090 THIS YOUNG GIRL IS CHARMING AND DOES CREDIT TO YOUR TASTE NOW AS I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL WE WILL RETURN TO OUR COMRADES AND DRAW LOTS FOR HER HAVE DETERMINED THEN TO ABANDON HER TO THE COMMON LAW SAID CARLINI

libri-org_7367-86737-0093 HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE GLADE BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE CARLINI ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS HIMSELF LET US DRAW LOTS LET US DRAW LOTS CRIED ALL THE BRIGANDS WHEN THEY SAW THE CHIEF
libri-org_7367-86737-0094 THEIR DEMAND WAS FAIR AND THE CHIEF INCLINED HIS HEAD IN SIGN OF ACQUIESCENCE THE EYES OF ALL SHONE FIERCELY AS THEY MADE THEIR DEMAND AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE MADE THEM LOOK LIKE DEMONS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDING CARLINI WERE PLACED IN A HAT
libri-org_7367-86737-0095 AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE BAND DREW FORTH A TICKET THE TICKET BORE THE NAME OF DIOVOLACCIO HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD PROPOSED TO CARLINI THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHIEF

libri-org_7859-102519-0026 TO INDUCE HIM TO SURRENDER JUSTINIAN AND THE TREACHEROUS BARBARIAN DETERMINED TO ACCEPT THE BRIBE AND SENT SECRET ORDERS TO TWO OF HIS OFFICERS
libri-org_7859-102519-0027 THE EMPEROR LEARNT OF THE PLOT THROUGH HIS WIFE AND SAVED HIMSELF BY THE BOLD EXPEDIENT OF GOING AT ONCE TO ONE OF THE TWO KHAZAR CHIEFS AND ASKING FOR A SECRET INTERVIEW WHEN THEY WERE ALONE HE FELL ON HIM AND STRANGLED HIM
libri-org_7859-102519-0028 AND THEN CALLING ON THE SECOND KHAZAR SERVED HIM IN THE SAME FASHION BEFORE THE KHAN'S ORDERS HAD BEEN DIVULGED TO ANY ONE THIS GAVE HIM TIME TO ESCAPE AND HE FLED IN A FISHING BOAT OUT INTO THE EUXINE WITH A FEW FRIENDS AND SERVANTS WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO EXILE
libri-org_7859-102519-0029 WHILE THEY WERE OUT AT SEA A STORM AROSE AND THE BOAT BEGAN TO FILL ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS CRIED TO JUSTINIAN TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH GOD AND PARDON HIS ENEMIES ERE HE DIED BUT THE EMPEROR'S STERN SOUL WAS NOT BENT BY THE TEMPEST
libri-org_7859-102519-0030 MAY GOD DROWN ME HERE HE ANSWERED
libri-org_7859-102519-0031 THE BOAT WEATHERED THE STORM AND JUSTINIAN SURVIVED TO CARRY OUT HIS CRUEL OATH HE CAME ASHORE IN THE LAND OF THE BULGARIANS AND SOON WON FAVOUR WITH THEIR KING TERBEL WHO WANTED A GOOD EXCUSE FOR INVADING THE EMPIRE
libri-org_7859-102519-0032 AND FOUND IT IN THE PRETENCE OF SUPPORTING THE EXILED MONARCH WITH A BULGARIAN ARMY AT HIS BACK JUSTINIAN APPEARED BEFORE CONSTANTINOPLE
libri-org_7859-102519-0033 THERE WAS NO FIGHTING FOR THE ADHERENTS OF TIBERIUS WERE AS UNREADY TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR THEIR MASTER
libri-org_7859-102519-0034 SO JUSTINIAN RECOVERED HIS THRONE WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE HAD BY THIS TIME HALF FORGOTTEN HIS TYRANNY AND REGRETTED THE RULE OF THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS BUT THEY WERE SOON TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ERRED IN SUBMITTING TO THE EXILE
libri-org_7859-102519-0035 AND SHOULD HAVE RESISTED HIM AT ALL HAZARDS JUSTINIAN CAME BACK IN A RELENTLESS MOOD BENT ON NOTHING BUT REVENGING HIS MUTILATED NOSE AND HIS TEN YEARS OF EXILE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO SEND FOR THE TWO USURPERS WHO HAD SAT ON HIS THRONE
libri-org_7859-102519-0036 AS HE TRIED TO FLEE INTO ASIA JUSTINIAN HAD THEM LED ROUND THE CITY IN CHAINS AND THEN BOUND THEM SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE HIS THRONE IN THE CATHISMA THE IMPERIAL BOX AT THE HIPPODROME
libri-org_7859-102519-0037 THERE HE SAT IN STATE USING THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES AS A FOOTSTOOL WHILE HIS ADHERENTS CHANTED THE VERSE FROM THE NINETY FIRST PSALM THOU SHALT TREAD ON THE LION AND ASP THE YOUNG LION AND DRAGON SHALT THOU TRAMPLE UNDER THY FEET
libri-org_7859-102519-0038 AND APSIMARUS AFTER THIS STRANGE EXHIBITION THE TWO EX EMPERORS WERE BEHEADED THEIR EXECUTION BEGAN A REIGN OF TERROR FOR JUSTINIAN HAD HIS OATH TO KEEP AND WAS SET ON WREAKING VENGEANCE ON EVERY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN HIS DEPOSITION
libri-org_7859-102519-0039 AND PUT OUT THE EYES OF THE PATRIARCH WHO HAD CROWNED HIM THEN HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT OUT MEANER VICTIMS MANY PROMINENT CITIZENS OF CONSTANTINOPLE WERE SOWN UP IN SACKS AND DROWNED IN THE BOSPHORUS SOLDIERS WERE PICKED OUT BY THE DOZEN AND BEHEADED
libri-org_7859-102519-0040 A SPECIAL EXPEDITION WAS SENT BY SEA TO SACK CHERSON THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR'S EXILE BECAUSE HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTED
libri-org_7859-102519-0041 THESE ATROCITIES WERE MERE SAMPLES OF THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF JUSTINIAN IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SO MUCH DETESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPARATIVELY POPULAR IN THE DAYS OF HIS FIRST REIGN
libri-org_7859-102519-0042 THE ARMY OF THE TYRANT LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS WHEN PHILIPPICUS APPROACHED AND HE WAS LED FORTH AND BEHEADED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AN END TOO GOOD FOR SUCH A MONSTER THE CONQUEROR ALSO SOUGHT OUT AND SLEW HIS LITTLE SON TIBERIUS
libri-org_7859-102519-0043 WHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS HAD BORNE TO HIM DURING HIS EXILE SO ENDED THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS ON THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
libri-org_7859-102519-0044 THE SIX YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED WERE PURELY ANARCHICAL JUSTINIAN'S WILD AND WICKED FREAKS HAD COMPLETED THE DEMORALIZATION WHICH HAD ALREADY SET IN BEFORE HIS RESTORATION EVERYTHING IN THE ARMY AND THE STATE WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED AND OUT OF GEAR
libri-org_7859-102519-0045 IT REQUIRED A HERO TO RESTORE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND EVOLVE ORDER OUT OF CHAOS BUT THE HERO WAS NOT AT ONCE FORTHCOMING AND THE CONFUSION WENT ON INCREASING
libri-org_7859-102519-0046 TO REPLACE JUSTINIAN BY PHILIPPICUS WAS ONLY TO SUBSTITUTE KING LOG FOR KING STORK THE NEW EMPEROR WAS A MERE MAN OF PLEASURE AND SPENT HIS TIME IN PERSONAL ENJOYMENT LETTING AFFAIRS OF STATE SLIDE ON AS BEST THEY MIGHT
libri-org_7859-102519-0047 IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE WAS UPSET BY A CONSPIRACY
libri-org_7859-102519-0048 PHILIPPICUS WAS BLINDED AND COMPELLED TO EXCHANGE THE PLEASURES OF THE PALACE FOR THE RIGOURS OF A MONASTERY BUT THE COURT INTRIGUE WHICH DETHRONED PHILIPPICUS DID NOT PLEASE THE ARMY
libri-org_7859-102519-0049 WHO GAVE THE IMPERIAL CROWN TO THEODOSIUS OF ADRAMMYTIUM A RESPECTABLE BUT OBSCURE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES MORE MERCIFUL THAN ANY OF HIS EPHEMERAL PREDECESSORS
libri-org_7859-102519-0050 AFTER COMPELLING HIM TO TAKE HOLY ORDERS MEANWHILE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EMPIRE WAS VISIBLY BREAKING UP THE AFFAIRS BOTH OF THE REALM AND THE CITY WERE NEGLECTED AND DECAYING CIVIL EDUCATION WAS DISAPPEARING AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE DISSOLVED
libri-org_7859-102519-0051 AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
libri-org_7859-102519-0052 WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF LAYING SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE NO ONE HINDERED HIM FOR THE ARMY RAISED TO SERVE AGAINST HIM
libri-org_7859-102519-0053 THEY HAD PENETRATED INTO PHRYGIA
libri-org_7859-102519-0054 WITH EVERY EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS WHEN AT LAST THERE APPEARED THE MAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO SAVE THE EAST ROMAN EMPIRE FROM A PREMATURE DISMEMBERMENT
libri-org_7859-102519-0055 WHO HAD MADE A GREAT REPUTATION AMID THE FEARFUL DISASTERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE WAS NOW GENERAL OF THE ANATOLIC THEME THE PROVINCE WHICH INCLUDED THE OLD CAPPADOCIA AND LYCAONIA AFTER INDUCING THE SARACENS MORE BY CRAFT THAN FORCE
libri-org_7859-102519-0056 TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF AMORIUM LEO DISOWNED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE INCAPABLE THEODOSIUS AND MARCHED TOWARD THE BOSPHORUS THE UNFORTUNATE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT COVETED THE THRONE HE OCCUPIED NOR MUCH DESIRED TO RETAIN IT
libri-org_8629-261139-0000 ALL THE WITNESSES WHO HAD ANYTHING TO SAY HAD LONG AGO GIVEN IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND WHEN AT OR NEAR NOON
libri-org_8629-261139-0001 IT WAS TO FIND IN TWO FACES ONLY ANY SIGNS OF THE EAGERNESS AND EXPECTANCY WHICH FILLED HIS OWN BREAST TO SUFFOCATION BUT AS THESE FACES WERE THOSE OF AGNES HALLIDAY AND AMABEL PAGE
libri-org_8629-261139-0002 HE SOON RECOGNISED THAT HIS OWN JUDGMENT WAS NOT AT FAULT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUTWARD APPEARANCES AND THE LANGUID INTEREST SHOWN IN THE NOW LAGGING PROCEEDINGS
libri-org_8629-261139-0003 BUT VITAL CONSEQUENCE FREDERICK WAS NOT VISIBLE IN THE GREAT HALL BUT THAT HE WAS NEAR AT HAND SOON BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE CHANGE SWEETWATER NOW SAW IN AMABEL
libri-org_8629-261139-0004 FOR WHILE SHE HAD HITHERTO SAT UNDER THE UNIVERSAL GAZE WITH ONLY THE FAINT SMILE OF CONSCIOUS BEAUTY ON HER INSCRUTABLE FEATURES
libri-org_8629-261139-0005 AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
libri-org_8629-261139-0006 SMILED AS SHE MET HIS EYE WITH THAT CURIOUS SLOW DIPPING OF HER DIMPLES WHICH HAD MORE THAN ONCE CONFOUNDED THE CORONER AND RENDERED HER AT ONCE THE ADMIRATION AND ABHORRENCE OF THE CROWD
libri-org_8629-261139-0007 LOOKED AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
libri-org_8629-261139-0008 FROM WHICH HE HAD REMOVED THE RING WHICH UP TO THIS HOUR HE HAD INVARIABLY WORN ON HIS THIRD FINGER IN THIS GLANCE OF HERS AND THIS ACTION OF HIS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS TO MAKE THAT DAY MEMORABLE IN MANY HEARTS
libri-org_8629-261139-0009 AND TO HIM A FULL ATTENTION WAS BEING GIVEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOME REAL ENLIGHTENMENT WOULD COME AT LAST TO SETTLE THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY AMABEL'S INCOMPLETE AND UNSATISFACTORY TESTIMONY BUT NO MAN CAN FURNISH WHAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS
libri-org_8629-261139-0010 AND THE FEW FINAL MINUTES BEFORE NOON PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY ADDITION BEING MADE TO THE FACTS WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED FOR GENERAL CONSIDERATION AS THE WITNESS SAT DOWN THE CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE AS THE SLOW
libri-org_8629-261139-0011 HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
libri-org_8629-261139-0012 WITH A FELL AND STEADY PURPOSE HE FOUND HIS RIGHT HAND STEALING TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION SHE EXPECTED BETTER TO YIELD THAN FALL HEADLONG INTO THE PIT ONE WORD OF HERS WOULD OPEN
libri-org_8629-261139-0013 HE HAD NOT MEANT TO YIELD BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME NOW THAT HE MUST AT ONCE AND FOREVER CHOOSE BETWEEN A COURSE THAT LED SIMPLY TO PERSONAL UNHAPPINESS AND ONE THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY HIMSELF
libri-org_8629-261139-0014 BUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSE
libri-org_8629-261139-0015 WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
libri-org_8629-261139-0016 AND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIS FINGER IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION OF ASSENT WHICH AMABEL AWAITED WITH BREATHLESS EXPECTATION WHEN WAS IT MIRACLE OR ONLY THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BETTER NATURE
libri-org_8629-261139-0017 THE MEMORY OF A FACE FULL OF HOLY PLEADING ROSE FROM THE PAST BEFORE HIS EYES AND WITH AN INNER CRY OF MOTHER HE FLUNG HIS HAND OUT AND CLUTCHED HIS FATHER'S ARM IN A WAY TO BREAK THE CHARM OF HIS OWN DREAD
libri-org_8629-261139-0018 AND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSE
libri-org_8629-261139-0019 WHICH TO THEIR TWO HEARTS IF TO NO OTHERS SEEMED STRANGELY APPROPRIATE FOLLOWED THE CESSATION OF THESE SOUNDS THEN THE WITNESS WAS DISMISSED AND AMABEL
libri-org_8629-261139-0020 WHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDED
libri-org_8629-261139-0021 EVERYONE WAS ASTOUNDED NO ONE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM HIM AND INSTINCTIVELY EVERY EYE TURNED TOWARDS AMABEL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS AFFECTED BY HIS ACTION STRANGELY EVIDENTLY
libri-org_8629-261139-0022 EVER FORGOT THOUGH IT CONVEYED NO HINT OF HER REAL FEELINGS WHICH WERE SOMEWHAT CHAOTIC FREDERICK WHO HAD FORGOTTEN HER NOW THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SPEAK WAITED FOR THE CORONER'S REPLY IF YOU HAVE TESTIMONY
libri-org_8629-261139-0023 SAID THAT GENTLEMAN AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW HURRIED WORDS WITH MISTER COURTNEY AND THE SURPRISED KNAPP YOU CAN DO NO BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO US AT ONCE MISTER FREDERICK SUTHERLAND WILL YOU TAKE THE STAND
libri-org_8629-261139-0024 WITH A NOBLE AIR FROM WHICH ALL HESITATION HAD VANISHED FREDERICK STARTED TOWARDS THE PLACE INDICATED BUT STOPPED BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN A HALF DOZEN STEPS

libri-org_8629-261139-0027 NO ONE SO MUCH AS MADE A GESTURE OF DISAPPROVAL THEN MISTER SUTHERLAND STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET CAST ONE LAST LOOK AROUND HIM AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH A DOOR WHICH HAD OPENED LIKE MAGIC BEFORE HIM THEN AND NOT TILL THEN
libri-org_8629-261139-0028 DID FREDERICK MOVE FORWARD THE MOMENT WAS INTENSE THE CORONER SEEMED TO SHARE THE UNIVERSAL EXCITEMENT
libri-org_8629-261139-0029 THIS YOU WILL BELIEVE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE PERSON MISS PAGE FOLLOWED INTO MISSUS WEBB'S HOUSE AND WHOM SHE HEARD DESCEND THE STAIRS DURING THE MOMENT SHE CROUCHED BEHIND THE FIGURE OF THE SLEEPING PHILEMON IT WAS MORE
libri-org_8629-261139-0030 INFINITELY MORE THAN ANYONE THERE HAD EXPECTED
libri-org_8629-261139-0031 AND THE SHOCK THE SURPRISE
libri-org_8629-261139-0032 WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
libri-org_8629-261139-0033 THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE MADE THEMSELVES HEARD IN DESPITE OF THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE PLACE AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE POLICE TO FREDERICK IT WAS A MOMENT OF IMMEASURABLE GRIEF AND HUMILIATION
libri-org_8629-261139-0034 ON EVERY FACE IN EVERY SHRINKING FORM IN SUBDUED MURMURS AND OPEN CRIES HE READ INSTANT AND COMPLETE CONDEMNATION AND YET IN ALL HIS LIFE FROM BOYHOOD UP TO THIS HOUR NEVER HAD HE BEEN SO WORTHY OF THEIR ESTEEM AND CONSIDERATION
libri-org_8629-261139-0035 HE DID NOT LOSE HIS DETERMINED ATTITUDE HE HAD OBSERVED A CHANGE IN AMABEL AND A CHANGE IN AGNES AND IF ONLY TO DISAPPOINT THE VILE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE
libri-org_8629-261139-0036 HE WITHSTOOD THE CLAMOUR AND BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN BEFORE THE CORONER HAD BEEN ABLE TO FULLY RESTORE QUIET I KNOW SAID HE
libri-org_8629-261139-0037 BUT IF ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO ME THINKS ME GUILTY OF THE DEATH I WAS SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO HAVE WITNESSED
libri-org_8629-261139-0038 DOCTOR TALBOT AND YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY IN THE FACE OF GOD AND MAN I HERE DECLARE THAT MISSUS WEBB IN MY PRESENCE AND BEFORE MY EYES
libri-org_8629-261139-0039 GAVE TO HERSELF THE BLOW WHICH HAS ROBBED US ALL OF A MOST VALUABLE LIFE SHE WAS NOT MURDERED IT WAS A SOLEMN ASSERTION BUT IT FAILED TO CONVINCE THE CROWD BEFORE HIM AS BY ONE IMPULSE MEN AND WOMEN BROKE INTO A TUMULT
libri-org_8629-261139-0040 SHE WAS TOO GOOD IT'S ALL CALUMNY A WRETCHED LIE BROKE IN UNRESTRAINED EXCITEMENT FROM EVERY PART OF THE LARGE ROOM IN VAIN THE CORONER SMOTE WITH HIS GAVEL IN VAIN THE LOCAL POLICE ENDEAVOURED TO RESTORE ORDER
libri-org_8629-261139-0041 THE TIDE WAS UP AND OVER SWEPT EVERYTHING FOR AN INSTANT
libri-org_8629-261139-0042 OF AMABEL SMOOTHING OUT THE FOLDS OF HER CRISP WHITE FROCK WITH AN INCREDULOUS ALMOST INSULTING SMILE THAT AT ONCE FIXED ATTENTION AGAIN ON FREDERICK HE SEIZED THE OCCASION AND SPOKE UP IN A TONE OF GREAT RESOLVE
libri-org_8629-261139-0043 I HAVE MADE AN ASSERTION SAID HE BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE THIS JURY TO MAKE IT SEEM A CREDIBLE ONE I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY OWN STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AM I ALLOWED TO DO SO MISTER CORONER YOU ARE
libri-org_8629-261139-0044 WAS THE FIRM RESPONSE THEN GENTLEMEN CONTINUED FREDERICK STILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT AMABEL WHOSE SMILE HAD ACQUIRED A MOCKERY THAT DREW THE EYES OF THE JURY TOWARD HER MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE FOLLOWING RECITAL
libri-org_8629-261139-0045 YOU KNOW AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY NOW KNOW THAT MISSUS WEBB HAS LEFT ME THE GREATER PORTION OF THE MONEY OF WHICH SHE DIED POSSESSED I HAVE NEVER BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGED TO ANYONE NOT EVEN TO THE GOOD MAN WHO AWAITS THIS JURY'S VERDICT
libri-org_8629-261139-0046 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR YONDER THAT SHE HAD REASONS FOR THIS GOOD REASONS REASONS OF WHICH UP TO THE VERY EVENING OF HER DEATH
libri-org_8629-261139-0047 OR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAY
libri-org_8629-261139-0048 I CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAY
libri-org_8629-261139-0049 AND QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING A VERY UNSELFISH ACT STILL THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE REASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO INTRUDE UPON HER LATE AT NIGHT WITH A PLEA FOR A LARGE LOAN OF MONEY HAD I NOT BEEN IN A DESPERATE CONDITION OF MIND
libri-org_8629-261139-0050 WHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCE
libri-org_8629-261139-0051 AS I HAD BEEN TOLD EARLY IN THE EVENING A SMALL ENTERTAINMENT WAS BEING GIVEN WHICH WOULD INSURE ITS BEING OPEN EVEN AT SO LATE AN HOUR AS MIDNIGHT MISS PAGE WHO WILL I AM SURE PARDON THE INTRODUCTION OF HER NAME INTO THIS NARRATIVE
libri-org_8629-261139-0052 HAS TAKEN PAINS TO DECLARE TO YOU THAT IN THE EXPEDITION SHE HERSELF MADE INTO TOWN THAT EVENING SHE FOLLOWED SOME PERSON'S STEPS DOWN HILL THIS IS VERY LIKELY TRUE AND THOSE STEPS WERE PROBABLY MINE FOR AFTER LEAVING THE HOUSE BY THE GARDEN DOOR
libri-org_8629-261139-0053 AND SO HASTENED ON TILL I CAME TO THE GATE ON HIGH STREET HERE I HAD A MOMENT OF HESITATION AND THOUGHTS BITTER ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECALL THEM AT THIS MOMENT CAME INTO MY MIND
libri-org_8629-261139-0054 BUT THEY PASSED THANK GOD AND WITH NO MORE DESPERATE FEELING THAN A SULLEN INTENTION OF HAVING MY OWN WAY ABOUT THIS MONEY I LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE FRONT DOOR AND STEPPED IN
libri-org_8629-261139-0055 OR AT LEAST TO HEAR THE SOUND OF MERRY VOICES AND LAUGHTER IN THE ROOMS ABOVE BUT NO SOUNDS OF ANY SORT AWAITED ME INDEED THE HOUSE SEEMED STRANGELY SILENT FOR ONE SO FULLY LIGHTED AND ASTONISHED AT THIS
libri-org_8629-261139-0056 I PUSHED THE DOOR AJAR AT MY LEFT AND LOOKED IN AN UNEXPECTED AND PITIFUL SIGHT AWAITED ME
libri-org_8629-261139-0057 I SAW THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD ON HIS ARMS ASLEEP THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD FAILED TO ARRIVE AND HE TIRED OUT WITH WAITING HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE AT THE BOARD
libri-org_8629-261139-0058 THIS WAS A CONDITION OF THINGS FOR WHICH I WAS NOT PREPARED MISSUS WEBB WHOM I WISHED TO SEE WAS PROBABLY UP STAIRS AND WHILE I MIGHT SUMMON HER BY A STURDY RAP ON THE DOOR BESIDE WHICH I STOOD I HAD SO LITTLE DESIRE TO WAKE HER HUSBAND
libri-org_8629-261139-0059 OF WHOSE MENTAL CONDITION I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO MAKE ANY LOUD NOISE WITHIN HIS HEARING YET I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RETREAT ALL MY HOPE OF RELIEF FROM THE MANY DIFFICULTIES THAT MENACED ME
libri-org_8629-261139-0060 LAY IN THE GENEROSITY OF THIS GREAT HEARTED WOMAN AND IF OUT OF PUSILLANIMITY
libri-org_8629-261139-0061 NOTHING BUT SHAME AND DISASTER AWAITED ME YET HOW COULD I HOPE TO LURE HER DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT NOISE I COULD NOT AND SO YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT WITHOUT ANY REALISATION
libri-org_8629-261139-0062 I SLIPPED UP THE NARROW STAIRCASE
libri-org_8629-261139-0063 FOR SHE ROSE AND MEETING MY EYE WITH A GAZE IN WHICH SHOCK AND SOME STRANGE AND POIGNANT AGONY TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME WERE STRANGELY BLENDED SHE CRIED OUT NO NO FREDERICK YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
